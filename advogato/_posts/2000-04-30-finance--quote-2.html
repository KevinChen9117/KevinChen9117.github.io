Finance::Quote 0.18 is now out the door, and available and
advertised via CPAN, Freshmeat, Sourceforge, etc.  Now that
we have a reasonably stable library out the door we can
start working on new features.  (Like currency conversion or
a decent OO re-write.)

<B>Ian</b><BR>
I must apologise for saying that Ian purchased a ludicrously
expensive lockable sun-roof on wheels because his old car
lost that 'new' smell.  Apparently Ian's car was a couple of
years old when he purchased it, and he had been spraying it
with a can of "new car smell" to keep it smelling new.
<P>
I now know that Ian purchased a ludicrously expensive
lockable sun-roof on wheels because his can of "new car
smell" ran out.  *grin*
<P>
In Ian's favour, he did climb the Green 15 out at hardrock. 
I'm very impressed.

The first game starts shortly.  We almost have a full
compliment of players signed up.
