<b>SCUBA::Table::NoDeco</b><br/>
When planning to go on a number of dives I usually pull out my dive tables and calculate by-hand depth, times, and surface intervals, to make sure that those dives are actually safe to perform.  Because this is done by hand it can be a real chore when faced with a number of potential dives throughout the day, and a desire to put those dives into a coherant dive plan.
<p>
As such, I've written <tt>SCUBA::Table::NoDeco</tt>, appearing soon at a CPAN mirror near you.  Make sure you read the disclaimer before use and verify the final results by hand.  I wouldn't trust my life to a 0.01 release module.
<p>
Once I had the module working, creating an <a href="http://pjf.id.au/dive/calc.html">on-line dive planner</a> was easy.  Currently only the SSI tables are loaded.  I do have a number of other tables availale, but entering the tables is a time-consuming process, so patches are very welcome.
