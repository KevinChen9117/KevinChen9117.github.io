<b>Is Your Flag HOT or NOT</b><br/>
A few more improvements to <a href="http://hotornot.perltraining.com.au/flags/">Is Your Flag HOT or NOT</a>.  I added a brief history of <a href="http://hotornot.perltraining.com.au/flags/meet/UNST059.html">the Oklahoma flag</a>, and more amusingly, the history of the <a href="http://hotornot.perltraining.com.au/flags/meet/THAL001.html">Thai National Flag</a>.  Other improvements include better navigation on the <a href="http://hotornot.perltraining.com.au/flags/hottest.html">HOTTEST</a> and <a href="http://hotornot.perltraining.com.au/flags/nottest.html">NOTTEST</a> pages, allowing visitors to see more than just the top 10 in each category.
