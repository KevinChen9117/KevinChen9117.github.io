<b>Perl Tip of the Week</b><br/>
I'm sure that I'm there are heaps of 'tip of the week' lists out there, but that's no reason why there can't be another.  <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a> is starting a <i>Perl Tip Of The Week</i> service.
<p>
The list will focus upon information that we feel will be most useful to our current and future clients, however it's free for anyone to join who may be interested, provided you don't mind getting a schedule of our upcoming courses with each tip.  The <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/perl-tips">subscription page</a> is up and running, and the first tip will be sent out soon.
