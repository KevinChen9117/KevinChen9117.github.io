<B>Stress</b><BR>
I can't wait until we hit the easter holidays and most of my current projects will be finished, and I'll be able to catch up with an incredible backlog of paperwork and things-to-do.
<p>
Running a business and bein that business' main product leaves one with very little time for anything else.
<p>
I'm going to try and move towards a more academic role in future.  More reearch, more writing, more speaking, and less commercial-client work.  This will probably mean a lower income, but more available time, and a higher quality of life.  I'm willing to accept that.
<p>
