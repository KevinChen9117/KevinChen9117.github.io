<B>Wedding</b><BR>
Yup, it's tomorrow.  We've done the rehersal.  We've had a bit  of dinner beforehand.  Jacinta's gone off to her grandmother's place, where's she'll be dressing up and everything tomorrow before the big event.
<p>
I still have to write a speech, although I'm not too worried about that, being a regular public speaker has its advantages.  There's a bunch of work things that I would have like to have done before the day, but they'll have to wait.
<p>
Right now, I'm kicking back, listening to <a href="http://www.di.fm/">some tunes</a>, and just taking it easy.  We've got house-sitters all organised, and all those wedding things, and most things in the business should run themselves.

Managed to drop my inbox down to less than 150 messages (down from 600).

<B>Dive Medical</b><BR>
On our honeymoon we're planning on doings lost of diving.  However, I used to be asthmatic.  Uh-oh.  Diving as an asthmatic in Australia is a no-no.  The problem isn't that you may get asthma underwater and you can't use a bronchiodilator (eg, ventolin).  The problem is that asthma means you lose lung capacity, which can mean trapped air.  If you're underwater, and rise to the surface (or to less depth) that air will expand.  If it expands too much, you can pop a lung.
<p>
Popping a lung isn't nice, but not the biggest thing to worry about.  Air in the bloodstream after you've damaged your lung is a much bigger worry.  It can give you an embolism, causing brain damage, permanent paralysis, or death.  That's bad.
<p>
So, you can imagine that my doctor was cautious about even thinking about passing my medical after hearing that I used to have asthma.  I got to visit a respiritory lab to be given bronchioconstrictants (lung-irritants) and my reaction measured.
<p>
The good news is, my reactions were considered to be well within the normal range, and as such I'm considered "fit to dive".  I'm still going to be cautious, an ex-asthmatic is still more likely to have problems than a regular person.  I suspect that if I do feel any tightness of chest underwater, I'll need to go against my regular instincts and ensure that I stay under until it passes.

<B>Advice to business-owners</b><BR>
If you think that your tech-magician, who's getting married the next day, gives a toss that you've having problems with machines after you've completely disregarded his advice, then you're completely mistaken.  He can deal with your problems any day.  He's only going to get married once.

Goodwill is like a bank.  You can deposit into it, and you can withdraw from it when things are tough.  But if you try to withdraw from it when it's empty, it's going to end up costing you a lot.
