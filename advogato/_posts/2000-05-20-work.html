<B>Work</b><BR>
Just call me bug-boy again.  Caught a good specimen of a
nasty bug I've trying to track for weeks, and if I can't fix
the cause I think I can treat the symptoms.
<P>
Also have Support going after some nasty bugs that have
become more public recently.  Again these are hard ones --
the source is unknown, but the symptoms might be treatable
as well.
<P>
I'm afraid that John (our CEO) is regressing back to his
previous corporate lifestyle, and has lost some of the
laid-backness we had instilled him with.  We might have to
try aversion therapy on him or something.
<P>
<B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
Fun to play, fun to watch.

<B>Hackey-sack</b><BR>
What a violent game.  I sustained another hackey injury
today.  I don't like playing hackey in shoes, but it can
hurt when you're trying to steal the hack off someone who
is.
