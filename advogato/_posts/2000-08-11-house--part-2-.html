<B>House (part 2)</b><BR>
Everything's organised and then... the vendor doesn't want
to sell.  She's just had a falling out with her brother and
wants to stay in the house rather than sell it.  Real estate
agent is currently trying to convince her that after all
this hard work she really does want to sell, possibly with
an extended settlement period so she can't stay there in the
short-term.  (Extended settlement period is even better for
me, so I don't mind if that happens.)
<P>
<B>Fire training</b><BR>
Lots of fun.  Got to put out fires and go through
smoke-tunnels and play with fire extinguishers and watch
videos and wear hard-hats and special clothing.  Cool
stuff.  I want to do extra courses if possible.
