<B>Advogato</b><BR>
Still an observer, despite the Journeyer status before.  I
guess I'll have to make new friends and influence people.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Had a slew of mail regarding Finance::Quote recently,
including another potential developer.  <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.org/person/brentn>Brent</a> has
joined the project at SourceForge and looks like he'll stick
with us for a while.  Our second developer is interested in
doing an OO-rewrite (which I'd also like to see), although
he has a few hesitations.  Hopefully he'll like us enough to
join
<P>
<B>Money transfers</b><BR>
Had a very long and problematic time getting my money
transfer.  Every overseas traveller this side of Adelaide
seemed to be at the Western Union office, and I had to wait
a considerable time in the queue.  When I finally got served
I had to prove who I was.  I don't drive, I don't have a
passport, and they didn't seem interested in any other form
of ID.  After much searching I found my old expired
learner's permit which they accepted.
<P>
In the future I might accept payment in other forms, like
Perl Journal subscriptions or books.

<B>Holidays!</b><BR>
Holidays!  Holidays!  Hooray!  Hooray!  I have no work until
Thursday.  A whole week off.  Yay!
