<b>Business shuts down in December</b><br/>
I don't know where it myth came from, but it's certainly not true when it comes to training and IT consultancy in Australia.  December has been insane, and continues to be so.  Every couple of days we seem to have a new business appearing out of the ether to need work done urgently.
<p>
Recent jobs have included training for yet another bank, diaster recovery planning for a retail hardware store, changes to management software for caravan parks, and some requests for really big training packages (5-20 days) from big business and government, both in Australia and overseas.  It's been a real mixed bag of work.
<p>
All of these combined with Jacinta going on leave soon, and a huge backlog of work that I'm still clearing after the conference, means that I'll probably be getting very little sleep until I also go on leave.
