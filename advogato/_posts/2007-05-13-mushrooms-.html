<p><b>Mushrooms!</b><br />
Went mushrooming on the weekend with friends.  We were looking for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanterelle">chanterelles</a> but all our regular spots had none; probably because it was too early in the season, and a lack of rain in general.
<p>
In exploring for new places we discovered a number of pullball mushrooms.  We didn't have any identification guides in the field, but having a vague recollection that Australia has no dangerous <i>true puffballs</i> we collected all we could find, with the hopes that we'd succeed in a positive ID back at base and find them edible.
<p>
To our great joy, we identified them as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycoperdon_perlatum">gem studded puffballs (Lycoperdon perlatum)</a>, using independent references in both English and Russian, with no communication between researchers. 
<p>
After slicing each one carefully to ensure we hadn't accidently collected any immature <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroying_angel">destorying angels</a> accidentally (a potential lethal mistake), we hesitantly fried and consumed our first puffball.  They're absolutely delcious fried in a little olive oil.  We sauted the rest in a wok, which produced good results, but not as good as the individually fried slices.
<p>
I think next time pan-frying with a sprinkle of garlic salt would produce a most acceptable dish.
