<p><b>Portland Adventures II</b><br>
Today is my last day in Portland, and wow, what an adventure it's been.  Friday was spent writing slides, relaxing in tea-houses (green mango bubble-tea with wifi rocks!), and a trip to <a href="http://portland.beerandblog.com/">Beer and Blog</a> at the Green Dragon.
<p>
Beer and Blog I was particularly pleased with on many different levels.  Ua had invited me to this fine establishment at last year's OSCON, and this represented me arriving, albeit a year late.  I had a chance to socialise with cool new people, although I didn't realise just <a href="http://twitter.com/WHIFFIES">how</a> <a href="http://fastwonderblog.com/about/">cool</a> some of them are until I did my research.
<p>
What made Beer and Blog really special was that during one of my conversations there was a comment that, "there's another Australian here, he's only just moved over".  That other Australian was <a href="http://twitter.com/McClure">Mike McClure</a>, with whom I went to University, but had not seen in about a decade!
<p>
Oh yes, Beer and Blog also had free beer.  That also made it special. ;)
<p>
That evening was I was given a tour of Portland by Schwern, Kate, Ua, and Nick.  That included beer, dinner, a walk along the river, and a trip to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voodoo_Doughnut">Voodoo Doughnuts</a>.  I'd been assured many times that my life would not be complete without having gone to Voodoo Doughnuts, and having been there, I can agree.
<p>
While I've been in Portland, <a href="http://chesnok.com/">Selena</a> has been a wonderful host, and I'd felt that I'd been a terrible guest.  Selena is a morning person, and I routinely came home late, slept in, and disappeared at odd times for ice-cream or doughnuts.  On Saturday morning, I was determined to buck this trend.

With thanks to Jacinta and Schwern who went on a secret ninja grocery mission, I got up extra-early and prepared breakfast.  Coffee, juice, amazing toast, and an omelette made with thinly sliced super-fresh swiss brown mushrooms.  The look on Selena's face and the huge thank-you hug made it all worthwhile.  ;)
<p>
The rest of Sunday was amazing.  After a snooze I made it to <a href="http://pdxpipeline.wordpress.com/2009/07/09/portland-theater-star-trek-in-the-park-july-11-26/">Trek in the Park</a>.  This is theatre at its absolute finest.  Trek in the Park is brimming over with quality, humour, and superb acting.  If you haven't seen it yet, then tonight and next weekend are your last chances to do so, and it won't cost you a cent.
<p>
I wore my starfleet uniform to Trek in the Park, which was a huge win.  I had arrived a little late, but many members of the audience members must have assumed that I was part of the production, and as such I was able to get a rather nice seat.  But the biggest win was the cast reaction; having a guy in uniform and an Australian accent seemed to be something special, which meant that I had no problems meeting the cast, learning about the production, and getting lots and lots of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=2091260&l=08db68476b&id=549169610">photographs</a>.  One amusing fact about the whole thing is that in true cosplay fashion, all the uniforms were made by Kirk's mum.  ;)
<p>
In the evening was dinner with <a href="http://twitter.com/stacybird">Stacy</a>, one of my most favourite Portlandians.  Stacy was <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=559">my guide at OSCON 2008</a>, where she gave up much of her time to show me around town, explain the local customs and delicacies, educate me regarding local mushrooms, and stop me from cycling on the wrong side of the road.  Stacy was out and about bicycle-hiking this week, but cut short her trip and cycled all the way back to Portland in record time for dinner, making me feel incredibly special.
<p>
Today ends my Portland adventures, as I head to San Jose for OSCON 2009, where I'm presenting <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009/public/schedule/detail/8451">Doing Perl Right</a> and <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009/public/schedule/detail/8165">The Art of Klingon Programming</a>.
