<B>SCSI Pain</b><BR>
Have the new SCSI card, new cable, new drive.  Put them all into the machine, and end up with an extremely painful set of errors from the aic7xxx module about how much it isn't enjoying the experience.
<p>
Oh well, fall back to the old tape drive.  Nope, it doesn't want to talk either, the advansys module wants to tell me how much pain it's in as well.
<p>
Scanner?  Yes, sometimes.  But sometimes not.  Seems to be depending upon how the whole chain is feeling that day.
<p>
Eventually tracked the damn thing down to the SCSI cards hating each other.  Depending upon the PCI slots they were in, and the phase of the moon, they may either work badly, or not at all.
<p>So, the lesser of the cards is now pulled from the machine.  This sucks, because I have both narrow and wide devices that I would like to connect, but only a wide controller in the machine.  Mixing narrow and wide on the same bus?  Uh uh, I've been there before.  Not doing <i>that</i> again.
<p>
I'm so sick of hardware.  I can't believe how painful it can be sometimes.
<p>
<B>OpenRPG</b><BR>
Recently started toying with a virtual table-top environment called <a href="http://www.openrpg.com/">OpenRPG</a>.  It has the advantages of being cross-platform (Mac, Linux, Windows), open source (GPL), written in Python (okay, I'm a Python weenie, but it could be a good reason to learn), around for a while, and under active development.
<p>
We tested OpenRPG in our face-to-face game for miniature and map management.  There were a few hiccups, and I'm hoping to iron them out using a newer (and apparently beta) release of the client.  Through use of wireless networking and existing loungeroom infrastructure (ie, a TV), I'm also hoping to make the experience more comfortable for the players as well.
<p>
One of the big advantages of OpenRPG is that if we can get it working, we'll have an excellent way to patch in one of our players who is currently stationed in northern Queensland, rather than trying to use a dinky webcam to give him an overview of any maps/miniatures.  Instead the dinky webcam can be used to give him an overview of all the players.
<p>
The only problem I've found with OpenRPG so far is that the servers are not sufficiently robust.  Twice today during suitability testing the server we were using died upon us.
<p>
<B>Holidays</b><BR>
My holidays are over.  This is incredibly sad, as I love holidays and rarely seem to be able to take them.  I spent most of my time playing games rather than doing anything remotely productive, and this was extremely relaxing and good.
<p>
I've got a quarter of a mind to scale back my workload at the end of this financial year, so that I can have more time.   The other three-quarters of my mind urge me to continue to generate as much revenue as possible, since retirement in 4-5 years will prove to be a wonderful experience, and the sooner I get there, the better.
<p>
I may end up taking something between the two, by trying to keep income constant rather than always increasing.
