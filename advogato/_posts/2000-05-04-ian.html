<B>Ian</b><BR>
Ian was very nice and drove me to a faraway place to get my
television repaired.  I'm glad that I don't drive, peak hour
traffic is awful, parking meters are expensive, and finding
parking spots is hard.  I'm very glad I have my $100 bicycle
which gets me home-to-work in 12 minutes with no pollution,
no expense, no parking hassles, and with a bit of healthy
exercise.  I'm still upset there aren't any more hills
between home and work, because I'm getting flabby with the
short trip.
<P>
Ian's also much become much better at rockclimbing than me,
so I'm incredibly jealous.
<P>
<B>Sofie</b><BR>
Sofie (Ian's partner) is going to come and work for
Schoolsnet in a couple of weeks.  This is good, because
Sofie appreciates good beer, whereas Ian and Benni don't.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Moving tomorrow, so I'm not expecting to get much done. 
Scotty tells me that I haven't been forgotten in bugland,
and that one day the promised land will come.  That's okay,
because I've got a bunch of bugs I'm going to be delegating
anyway.  :)
<P>
<B>Natedawg</b><BR>
Nate's practice at Half-Life is paying off.  He's become
incredibly good at Counter-Strike, probably because he plays
it very single night of the week.  He whipped our arses
hugely today, which was pretty humiliating.  To make things
worse, I'm going to be broken up from my old squad (Dancer
and Ben) as part of the move at work.
<P>
Nate also came climbing with us yesterday.  He looks pretty
spunky in my tight blue shorts.

<B>GnuCash</b><BR>
GnuCash is good.  Saved me money again by keeping a good
hold on my finances.  I'm most satisfied.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Benni has joined the Finance::Quote team and has offered to
do fun stuff with the web-page.  Thanks Benni!  (I suspect
the real reason is that he wants to write Advogato diaries
but feels he needs open-source experience to do so.)
