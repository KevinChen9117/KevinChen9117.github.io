<B>House</b><BR>
Made an offer on the house today, and there seems to be a
very good possibility that we'll be accepted as well.  We
should know in the next couple of days what's happening.  If
everything goes well we'll be moving in about three months
time.

<B>Permaculture</b><BR>
The local trainstation had a big impressive permaculture
poster up which appears to have been sponsored by the train
company.  Surprisingly enough it wasn't just "trains are
good" propaganda, but made mention of low-impact housing,
backyard food systems, and (surprisingly enough) <A
HREF="http://www.vmore.org.au/~damon/cm/">Critical
Mass.</a>.  It's good to see things like this going up
around the city -- sometimes it seems that any poster
advocating sustainability lives inside a University campus,
or leads a very brief existence before it's plastered over
with concert posters.

<B>Work</b><BR>
Friday drinks are finally becoming a little more organised
and are running more smoothly.  There was a small problem
where we miscalculated the horde of brew we were purchasing,
and a couple of the pizzas we ordered didn't come through. 
Depsite this everything seems to have gone well, and we have
what I hope to be a sustainable system in place.
<P>
I'm expecting to see a few sparks on Monday regarding some
mis-communication problems, and I think that we really need
a good priority system implemented for tasks, as not
everyone sees eye-to-eye about which tasks are the most
important.

<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
It works.  It's beautiful.  It's extensible.  It should be
released.  However, I haven't finished the API
documentation.  I should also check with Jon about when I'm
supposed to have my article for TPJ written -- there's
nothing like writing an article to speed up the next release
of a project.

<B>Melbourne Geeks</b><BR>
Rita, who used to work for Schoolsnet, is now working for
Allison, who I was trying to poach to Schoolsnet when Rita
first joined.  Allison also did software
engineering/computer science with Jacinta (who used to work
at Schoolsnet) and Elise (who now has my old job at ITS). 
Sometimes I get a feeling that I'm only one link away from
every other geek in Melbourne.
