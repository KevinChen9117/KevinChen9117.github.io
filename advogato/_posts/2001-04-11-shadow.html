<B>Shadow</b><BR>
Shadow has become extremely affectionate.  I suspect it's
because he's cold, but he completely refuses to be put down
now.  Whilst its a little more interesting trying to do most
tasks with a rabbit on one arm, I've found he's quite happy
to fall asleep in my lap as I type.  Well, except when he
jumped up on the keyboard and rearranged my mailbox...
