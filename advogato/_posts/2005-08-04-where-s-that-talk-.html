<p><b>Where's that talk?</b><br />
Often at user-group meetings and conferences I get asked if particular slides or papers will be published on-line.  Now you can find a lot (not all) of talks by Jacinta and myself online at <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/talks/">Perl Training Australia's presentations page</a>.
<p>
Other presentations and papers will go up when I collect a sufficient collection of tuits.
