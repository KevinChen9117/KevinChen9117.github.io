<p><b>Rocking out at MXUG</b><br>
For a while, Melbourne has been running <a href="http://groups.google.com.au/group/mxug">MXUG</a>, the <i>Melbourne X Users Group</i>, where X is a technology you're interested in.  It has a nice format: 15 minute talks, timed, with five minutes for questions.  Then beer, pizza, lightning talks, and a trip down to the pub.
<p>
Despite me apparently living in Melbourne, I've never attended a MXUG meeting, but I'd been hearing good reports about them.  Apparently one can become a speaker just by adding themselves to the speakers list (which is editable by members), and so I aggressively volunteered to give my (still formative) <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=591">talk on facebook privacy</a>.
<p>
The talk went really well.  The audience was warm, interactive, and laughed at all my jokes, <i>even the really lame ones</i>.  Since I judge my self-worth on the size and enthusiasm of my audience, I decided that I really liked MXUG.  Normally, that would be enough for me to call the night a success.
<p>
However enough people asked me about how I used my wiimote as a presentation device, so I volunteered for one of the five minute lightning talks.  I had no slides.  I did no preparation.  I spent all the time I'd normally be working on my talk eating pizza, drinking beer, and talking to MXUG members.
<p>
So I was <i>especially</i> happy when I showed off how to use <a href="http://www.resplect.com/xwii">Xwii</a> to enable a tilt mouse, and as a presentation device.  I then showed off how I could use the wiimote to control my music player, and sung a few bars from "I've got a feeling" from Buffy on stage.  <i>That</i> would normally be enough to count the night as doubly-awesome, but oh no!  It gets better.
<p>
My last Xwii profile showed how I can hook into a Guitar Hero controller, "but I don't have one of those here, so I can't show you".  Sure enough, someone <i>produces a guitar out of nowhere</i>.  A few seconds to pair it with my machine, a few more seconds to start up <a href="http://fretsonfire.sourceforge.net/">Frets on Fire</a>, and <i>I am rocking out on stage in front of a cheering crowd of 50 people</i>.
<p>
I then got to sit back down in the audience, and read about my exploits on twitter.  ;)
<p>
That, ladies and gentlemen, was my thrice-awesome night at MXUG.
