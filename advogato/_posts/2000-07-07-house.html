<B>House</b><BR>
We made an offer on the house, and someone else made an
offer for the full asking price, so they got it.  I'm not
too upset, as there are plenty of other nicer houses out
there, and in a few months time I'll be in a much better
position to buy.  What I find interesting is that both Ian
and Sofie, and Benni and Tara are looking at buying houses
now.  It's almost looking like a Monopoly game.

<B>Banks</b><BR>
One of the banks who I was talking about home-loans with
wants to give me a complimentary credit card with an
outrageously large credit limit.  I'll be handing it back to
them.

<B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
Junwei is winning, and after this game I am going to have to
take lessons from him about how he does this.  Italy (Phil)
is eating out of Junwei's hand, and is probably going to
spur Junwei on to victory.  I think we're going to have a
hard time convincing Phil that possibly losing is better
than helping Junwei and definitely losing.  Unfortunately
being the second largest power, everything thinks I'm trying
to nobble Junwei so that I can win.  The truth is I want to
nobble Junwei so that I don't lose.  I'm much rather force
Junwei to draw than have him win the game.  I'm researching
stalemate lines to see what I can do.

<B>Work</b><BR>
Negotiating with Dan to try and get a nine day fortnight. 
Believe it or not, I actually want more of a life.  There's
been a lot of proceedural stuff flying around recently, and
not all of it is stable yet.  It should be good once it is, 
because as bug-boy I want quality more than most.

A legacy version of one of our products is now finally
finished, the customers using it having upgraded to the
latest and greatest.  This makes me very happy.

Spent some time at CERES (a beautiful environmental park)
and hacked together a lot more of the documentation.  The
project is almost ready for release, but I need to find some
spare time where <A HREF=http://www.adom.de/>ADOM</a>
doesn't tempt me too much so I can finish it.  I should also
get in contact with Jon again about The Perl Journal
article.

<B>Ian</b><BR>
Ian has his new car, and he's so proud.  I want him to act
as taxi-boy this weekend for rockclimbing.

Finally climbed Cretin, and (after Ian and Ben's most
helpful advice) discovered that it was much easier than
expected.

We have a <I>lot</i> of skill in Schoolsnet now.  I'm very
proud of everyone.  To quote Natedawg, <I>"We have the
reflexes of a momma!"</i>
