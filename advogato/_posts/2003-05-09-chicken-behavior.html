<B>Chicken Behavior</b><BR>
You're a chicken.  You're feeling thirsty.  You have the option of drinking:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Fresh rainwater collected in an empty pot, easily accessible.
<LI>Water from the drink-feeder, refilled yesterday afternoon, easily accessible.
<LI>Water from a stagnant bucket of rotted compost, complete with scum and floaties, difficult to reach.
</ul>
<P>
You know which of the above would have the most flavour, and so do our chickens.
<p>
I can't believe we eat the eggs of these birds.  On the other hand, I have an overwhelming admiration for their immune systems.

<B>Three easy steps to keeping your consultant happy</b><BR>
<OL>
<LI>Learn how to use the <tt>shift</tt> key for capitals and punctuation.  Learn how to use the <tt>enter</tt> key to make paragraphs.
<LI>When the consultant states that something is an incredibly bad idea, at least pause and think about that for a moment.  Don't respond by asking how soon it can be implemented.
<LI>Pay your invoices on time.
</ol>
