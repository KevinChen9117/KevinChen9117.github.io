<p><b>OSDC Talk - The Art of Klingon Programming</b><br>
For some reason, the <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/2008/papers/index.html">OSDC 2008 Programme</a> is missing talk abstracts.  However I don't believe the world should miss out on mine.
<p>
My talk is on Friday, 5th December, at 11:30am.

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>The art of Klingon Programming</i>
<p> 
A good programmer needs many qualities: intelligence, foresight, dedication, and the ability to fight off a hundred angry targh armed only with your bat'leth. On Qo'noS, software developers undertake an intensive course in combat programming before they are cleared for active duty. The tlhIngan traditions have long known one truth holds true for both glory in battle and software development:
<p>
<i>bIlujDI' yIchegh()Qo'; yIHegh()!</i>
<p>
It is better to die() than to return() in failure.
<p>
For too long, Perl has been a pujwI', and unsuitable for use by true warriors. In this talk we will show how the new <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?autodie">autodie</a> pragma can help you to code with batlh!

</blockquote>
<p>
Even if you don't know Perl, I can assure you the talk is going to be a whole lot of fun. ;)

<p>
For everyone who can't make it to OSDC because they're in a far-away place, like Europe or America, I do hope to visit in 2009.
