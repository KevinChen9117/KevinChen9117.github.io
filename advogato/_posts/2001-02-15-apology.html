<B>Apology</b><BR>
Sorry to everyone who's been trying to use my diary to keep
up with me and discovered I've been slack.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Finance::Quote 1.05 has been released, mainly bugfixes but a
few enhancements to make the life of people writing modules
easier.  Available on <A
HREF="https://sourceforge.net/projects/finance-quote.">SourceForge</a>
and your <A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/">local CPAN
store</a>.
<P>
<B>Consluting</b><BR>
Getting pretty busy, actually.  Have a few contracts that
I'm working on, as well as trying to get back into open
source properly.  Obsidian is moving along, and people are
pushing work through it, which is great.
