<B>GnuCash</b><BR>
Okay, I can't do nice accounts payable/receivable with a cash accounting system, because as it was kindly pointed out to me, they only really make sense under accruals.  In a cash-based system, you just ignore things which haven't happened yet.  This leaves me with a dilemma, since moving to accruals costs me about $50/year in lost interest (no big deal compared to time saved), but also bumps me out of the Simplified Tax System for five years (STS), and I may not want to do that.

Shopping around for accountants to talk about business structures, investing, tax, and other exciting things, like getting bumped out of the STS for five years because I want to change my books in such a way that the ATO will get more money.

<B>Interchange</b><BR>
Beem playing with <a href="http://www.icdevgroup.org/">InterChange</a> a bit.  I'm quite, quite impressed.  I'm looking at it for both use with <a href="http://perltraining.com.au">PTA</a>, and for the use of a number of customers.

<B>Travel</b><BR>
Canberra mid-June, Sydney late June, Sydney again next week, Sydney <i>again</i> two weeks after that, Canberra in all likelyhood after that...  Somehow I don't seem to be spending much time in my home city.

<B>Hardware</b><BR>
Got a new scanner off Ian, since my old one is about to die.  Haven't picked it up yet, hope to do so soon.  Got a new UPS, courtesy of a friend who's since moved to the UK, need to schedule some downtime to install it.
<p>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Stupidly busy.  It's crazy.  There was like a two week period where I hardly even saw my own office, since I had to be with a client saving the day, or in Sydney, or both.
