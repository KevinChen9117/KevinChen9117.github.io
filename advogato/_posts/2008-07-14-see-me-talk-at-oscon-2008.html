<p><b>See me talk at OSCON 2008</b><br>
Next week is <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/">OSCON 2008</a>, and I'll be presenting!  Since I'm Australian, and I know Perl, you can expect my presentations to be awesome.  ;)  You can come see me at:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/schedule/detail/3049">Perl Security</a>, 1:30pm - 5:00pm, Monday 21st July.
<li><a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/schedule/detail/3072">An Illustrated History of Failure</a>, 5:20pm - 6:05pm, Wednesday 23rd July.
<li><a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/schedule/detail/3170">General lightning talks</a>, 1:45pm-2:30pm, Thursday 24th July.
<li><a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/schedule/detail/3107">Hacking Wetware for Fun and Profit</a> (aka "Human Interfaces for Geeks"), 2:35pm-3:20pm, Thursday 24th July.
<li><a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/schedule/detail/2501">Perl lightning talks</a>, 4:30pm-5:15pm, Thursday 24th July.
</ul>
<p>
Of course the lightning talks will have other people presenting as well, and should be <i>heaps</i> of fun.  Anthony Baxter runs the <a href="http//www.osdc.com.au/">OSDC</a> lightning talks, and is also running the general lightning talks at OSCON.  OSDC has the best lightning talks ever.
<p>
On the topic of <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">OSDC</a>, you can see me presenting there as well (paper acceptance is not yet confirmed, actual results may vary), so come to Australia for OSDC from the 2nd-5th December!
