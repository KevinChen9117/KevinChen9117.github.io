<B>Conslutancy</b><BR>
Well, last Friday I waved goodbye to my former employer and 
I'm now my own boss.  I'm working as a conslutant, setting 
my own hours and managing my own affairs.  Spent today 
setting up the new firewall box and encouraging my mail to 
go to the right places.
<P>
Shall post a link to my resume soon, but people should feel 
free to e-mail me (pjf at cpan.org) if they're impatient or 
want to throw work at me without seeing the resume.  :)

<B>Fruit</b><BR>
Have ooodles of blood plums thanks to the tree outside.  I 
think about 30% of my food by weight comes from eating 
blood-plums.

<B>Obsidian</b><BR>
Going into business with a number of extremely clueful 
people.  Idea is to have something similar to <a 
href="http://www.cyber.com.au/">CyberSource</a> but with a 
smaller group, more flexibility, and with some serious 
tenders for larger projects.  Some things are quite scary, 
I'll probably want to have a good talk to a clueful 
accountant.
<P>
<B>Open Source</b><BR>
One of the big reasons for me dropping full-time work is so 
that I can spend more time on fun things like open-source.  
For the last couple of months I've been doing next to zip, 
I'm hoping to change that soon.  I'm still figuring out 
exactly what my week will look like, but I'm trying for 2 
days of (paid) work, 2 days of open-source/other projects, 
and 3 days of fun.
