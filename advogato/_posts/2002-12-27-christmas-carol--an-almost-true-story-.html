<B>Christmas Carol (an almost true story)</b><br>
On the Nth day of Christmas, my server gave to me:
<p>
a bad block on hda3.<br>
2 toasted drives;<br>
3 boxes down;<br>
4 volume backups;<br>
RAID-5 failure;<br>
6 friends a-leaving;<br>
7 megs of spam;<br>
8 failed recovers;<br>
9 hours restoring;<br>
10 calls from <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node=jarich">jarich</a>;<br>
11 clients off-line;<br>
12 hours downtime;<br>
<p>
<b>Notes</b><BR>
Yup, on the morning of Boxing Day, two of the drives in my RAID-5 developed bad-blocks within two hours of each other, resulting in complete failure of my main storage device.  After some failed attempts at resurrecting the array, I was forced to re-partition away the bad areas, reconstruct the RAID, re-format, and restore from tape.  Luckily my last backup was made a mere four hours before the failure, so the entire process occured with no data loss.  The drive that holds mail was unaffected, so I didn't lose any of the tremendous amount of spam that I seem to receive each day.
<p>
I'm investigating return of the limping drives to the manufacturer for replacement.

Remember:<br>
<ul>
<li>Make backups frequently.
<li>Test your backups frequently.
<li>Keep off-site backups.
<li>Murphy's law applies to RAIDs, too.
</ul>
