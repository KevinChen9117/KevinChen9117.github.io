<b>Just looking at the advertisements</b><br/>
Normally when people purchase a magazine, they do so for the content.  Ads usually get glanced at, and sometimes will invoke a reaction from the reader, but they're rarely the reason to purchase the magazine in the first place.
<p>
Yesterday I was working with Jacinta on an advertisement for <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a>.  Neither of us are marketing geeks or have great graphical design skills, so we decided to see how other people advertise.  We went through a number of magazines that we had received recently, and just looked at the ads.
<p>
It was only afterwards that we realised that despite spending considerable time examining those magazines, neithre of us had actually read any real content.  <i>"That was a magazine on business banking?  Are the articles any good?"; "I don't know.  I didn't read them either."</i>
<p>
I believe that our final, full-page, colour advertisement looks acceptably swish.  It will be appearing in next month's <i>Builder</i> magazine.

<b>Lemonade III</b><br/>
In order to use the (literally) buckets of lemons that are dropping from our tree, we've started <a href="http://pjf.id.au/brew/brews/11_lemonade.html">Lemonade III</a>.  We've learnt from our earlier attempts, and expect the final product to be quite drinkable.
<p>
Unfortunately, the yeast seems to be having trouble starting.  We're using a champagne yeast, and it may be having problems with the pH of the solution, which is quite acidic with all that lemon juice.  We've given it a kick today (a cup of warm active yeast and sugar), but if it still doesn't take after a few days we may need to change yeasts entirely.
