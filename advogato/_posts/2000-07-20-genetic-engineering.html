<B>Genetic Engineering</b><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.advogato.net/person/dancer/">Dancer</a>
raised in his diary the question of how is genetic
engineering different to what we've been doing to plants and
animals for years?  (Selective breeding and such.)
<P>
I feel that the main difference between GE and selective
breeding is that GE can introduce genetic material into
organisms which would never have evolved naturally, no
matter how much selective breeding was used.  An example
would be introducing anti-freeze genes from arctic fish into
strawberries.
<P>
Do I think that GE is bad?  In many cases I do, because I
feel
that it's being used as quick-fix to many problems and
hasn't been thought through properly.  A few examples:
<P>
<UL>
   <LI>GE "Round-up ready" herbicide resistant plants are
engineered.  These plants can withstand large dosages of
herbicides without dying.  The advantage is that you can
spray your fields with herbicides and only kill the weeds,
not the crop.  The downside is that the resulting crop will
have an increased amount of residual herbicides, and that
any weeds that survive are probably naturally resistant, and
will reproduce to give stronger, more resistant weeds next
year.
   <LI>Plants are GE'ed to make them stronger, tougher,
frost-resistant.  If these plants inter-breed with wild
plants, we can potentially end up with superweeds, which are
also tougher and stronger.  This is a real possibility with
plants like brasicas (spel?) (cabbages, brocolli, mustards)
which have a variety of domesticated and wild strains.
</ul>
In many instances, GE is no different to inventing a new
pesticide or herbicide. It works for a few years, but
eventually resistant strains result.
<P>
If we're using GE to modify micro-organisms to produce
useful substances, then that's fine, most of those things
won't survive in the wild anyway.  If we're using GE so we
can spray even more chemicals on our crops, then that's just
downright foolish.
