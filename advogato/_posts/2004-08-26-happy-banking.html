<b>Happy Banking</b><br/>
Final arrangements with my old bank went surprisingly smoothly, with my departure providing me with 28 bottles of wine (26 red, 12 white), a wine rack, $75 worth of gift vouchers, and about $250 worth of refunds on banking services.
<p>
The bank has refunded one item twice; once because I asked for it to be refunded, and a second time because I tried to exchange credit-card rewards points for it.  The bank doesn't seem to have a problem with this, and neither do I.
