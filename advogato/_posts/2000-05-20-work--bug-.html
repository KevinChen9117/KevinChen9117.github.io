<B>Work (bug)</b><BR>
Found the nasty bug that we were being caned about for the
last few days.  Many thanks goes to Humpy who helped track
down the offending chunk of code.  I think half the office
must have heard my bug finding, and a couple of them got
hugs because I was so happy.
<P>
If you're planning on writing software which I'm going to
have to debug, and want to save me a large amount of mental
grief, please try to adhere to the following rules:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Do it properly the first time, instead of marking the
code as "broken" and then never coming back to it.
<LI>Follow the relevant written standard, be it a RFC or
otherwise.
<LI>Think very hard about what happens in error cases.  Even
though you might not expect anything to go wrong, it will. 
Program very defensively.
<LI>Before using a program as part of a critical piece of
software, at least take the time to read the man-page.
</ul>
<P>
While not all of the above were a factor in this bug, I've
had to fix more than my fair share of bugs caused by them.
<P>
Me?  I've got to remember that when I do testing to try and
use exactly the same environment as the "real thing".  A
couple of hours could have been saved bug-hunting if I had
realised the software I was using for testing had been
patched to ignore SIGPIPEs.
<P>
<B>Fun</b><BR>
Had a great party last night, with many good friends over. 
DanielG brought over a beautiful bottle of port, which
Jacinta and I now have all to ourselves because everyone
else thought it was something other than port.  :)
<P>
<B>Work (Michelle)</b><BR>
Michelle, our office manager, left for greener pastures
yesterday.  We gave her our best wishes and farewells at a
nearby pub.  Michelle had been working at Schoolsnet for a
very long time, and has been responsible for many essential
processes and proceedures.  Her smiles and good nature will
be sorely missed.  I wish Michelle all the very best in her
new career.
<P>
<B>Tea</b><BR>
After getting directions from Junwei, I now have a good
supply of cyrsantheum (spel?) tea.  Yum!
<P>
<B>Work (Building Committee)</b><BR>
I've been elected on to the new building committee at work. 
There's a large amount of politics surrounding this, and I'm
rather honoured that my team has decided that I should
represent them.
<P>
<B>Sofie</b><BR>
Sofie's started at Schoolsnet, and we're working on
introducing her to the joys of hackey-sack.  Sofie is also a
trained masseuse, and I'm very thankful to her for helping
me relax after a nasty day of bug-hunting.
<P>
<B>Ian</b><BR>
Ian's a sweetie, and I'm glad that he cares about me so
much.  He's also picking up my (now fixed) television on
Monday.  What a guy!
