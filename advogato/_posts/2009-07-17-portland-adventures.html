<p><i>Portland Adventures</i><br>
Last year I went to <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/toc.html?tag=oscon2008">OSCON 2008</a> in Portland, Oregeon (PDX), and had a fantastic time.  I made many great friends, and fell in love with the town and its people.  I was looking forward to returning to PDX every year, but unfortunately this year OSCON moved to San Jose.
<p>
Not to be denied the Portland experience by mere conference shifts, I arranged to arrive in America a week early, and re-visit PDX the week before OSCON.  I'm here right now with <a href="http://use.perl.org/~jarich/journal/">Jacinta</a>, and have had an incredibly social time with friends both old and new.
<p>
We've been staying with <a href="http://www.chesnok.com/">Selena</a> who has been nothing short of amazing.  Accommodation, network access, food, transport, good coffee, and most of all fantastic company have made me feel extremely privileged.  Selena knows <i>everyone</i>, and is incredibly popular, so we get invited to all the cool events too!  I've met more people in the last two days than I can possibly count.  Selena also has a beautiful house; and I'm currently sitting under a tree, next to a pond, with a fountain, fish, power, and wireless.  I could happily make this my new office.
<p>
I've had a chance to catch up with <a href="http://www.katealaurel.com/">Kate</a> and <a href="http://schwern.org/">Schwern</a>, who caught me on the night I landed in PDX for gelato and conversation.  Hanging with Kate and Schwern is like fractal socialising; I'll meet someone, discover we have common interests, they'll introduce me to someone else, and the process repeats.  It was only at 2am when I was talking to Kate's house-mate's boyfriend about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_the_gathering">Magic: The Gathering</a> that my body reminded me that I hadn't slept in a real bed for more than 48 hours, and that passing out in the middle of a conversation would probably be considered impolite.
<p>
Yesterday I went to the Portland Pirate Shop with the intention of picking up a puffy white shirt, and was informed that I had just missed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plunderathon">Plunderathon</a>, and that all the puffy shirts are gone, so I was doubly sad.  Next year I'll need to make sure to arrive in PDX much earlier, so I can participate in costumed piratical goodness.
<p>
Picking what to do in the evening was hard.  Portland seems to be the place where on a Thursday night one needs to choose between a mountain-biking festival, PostgreSQL user-group, Perl hackathon, and <a href="http://www.igniteportland.com/">Ignite Portland</a>.  It's a great place to be a geek.  ;)
<p>
In the evening I made it to Ignite, which I've decided that I <i>have</i> to speak at if I get the chance.  The audience is relaxed, friendly, looking to be entertained, and all have beer.  The talks were pretty good, too.  I even met one person who recognised me from my work on the Perl 5.8.9 release notes.
<p>
Afterwards I made it to the tail end of the hackathon, drank <a href="http://justatheory.com/">David's</a> beer at a pub that had a huge number of board-games, and retired back to Selena's with Schwern and Jacinta, where we talked late into the night about all sorts of Perl community ideas, including a cute little plan involving community achievement badges that I like to think of as "Perl Scouts". ;)
