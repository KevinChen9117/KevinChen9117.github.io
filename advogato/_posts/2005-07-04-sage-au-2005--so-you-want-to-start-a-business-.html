<p><b>SAGE-AU 2005: So you want to start a business?</b><br/>
<blockquote>
Paul Fenwick has always had an entrepreneurial bent. At the age of six he went into retail, setting up a street-side stall to sell four-leaf clovers from a mutant plant in the family garden. Two years later Paul's attempts to market mutant funnel-webs failed disastrously, and after returning from hospital he discovered that his all his Spiderman comics had been burnt. This was Paul's first lesson that the world of small business is not always an easy one.

That's my biography for my <a href="http://www.sage-au.org.au/conf/sage-au2005/speakers.html#fenwickabs">Small Business Talk</a> to be held at <a href="http://www.sage-au.org.au/conf/sage-au2005/">SAGE-AU 2005</a> which runs from the 5th&mdash;9th September in Perth this year.

I've got oodles of other interesting news (interesting to me, anyway) which has to go through all the appropriate channels before I can write about it publicly.  That's why I'm writing blatent advertisements for SAGE-AU 2005 instead.
