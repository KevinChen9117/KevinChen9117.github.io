<B>Naughty Bunny</b><BR>
It seems that <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/~pjf/pics/shadow-evil.jpg">our bunny</a> is not the only one out there that has caused technical difficulties.  Ian recently directed us to a page about anoter <a href="http://home.iprimus.com.au/cojoco/Naughty_Bunny.html">naughty bunny</a>.

I think the glowing red eyes and the shiny black coat is an indication your rabbit may be evil.  I'm not sure what <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/~pjf/pics/shadow-good.jpg">faintly glowing blue eyes</a> mean.
