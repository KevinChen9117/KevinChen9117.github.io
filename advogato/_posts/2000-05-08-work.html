<B>Work</b><BR>
We're in the new building, and it seems that just about
everything got moved across okay.  A lot of people spent a
lot of time over the weekend making sure that things went
smoothly for us today, and I'm very grateful for that.
<P>
There was a small hiccup where my mouse and speakers ended
up in <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.org/person/dancer>Dancer's</a> bin
(the removalists put them there), but otherwise things went
without a hitch.
<P>
The coffee machine isn't plumbed in yet, so we have to use
the back-up machine which isn't anywhere near as good.

<B>Luke and DataServe</b><BR>
It looks like not only have I met <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.org/person/lukeh>Luke</a> before, I
worked with him.  <A
HREF=http://www.dataserve.org>DataServe</a> was a company
created by Luke and some mutual friends of ours a long time
ago, about when I was 12-13.  Luke even found my old report
(I was head of the Commodore division), where I discussed
some of the software I was working on at the time.
<P>
I'm glad that Luke kept all these documents, they bring back
many memories of when I was a little geek, instead of being
the big geek I am now.  I think that if DataServe were to be
reformed today it would prove to be a quite successful
company -- the people in it have certainly gone on to prove
themselves to be quite talented.

It's very pretty, has a nice feel, and so far has a
reasonable plot.  Pity I suck at it.   Ian will probably be
dissapointed in me.
