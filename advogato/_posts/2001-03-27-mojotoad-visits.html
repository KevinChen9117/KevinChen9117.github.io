Okay, it's been a while since I've written.  Sorry about
that.  Here's a catch-up on what's been happening.
<P>
<B>Mojotoad Visits</b><BR>
Jacinta and I met with with <a href="/person/mojotoad/">mojotoad</a> the
other day, who's doing his world-victory-lap after being
published in <A HREF="http://www.tpj.com/">The Perl
Journal</a> along with yours truly.  We had a few pints and
went out for Indian.  Talked about everything from computers
and geek stuff to biblical fruit and erosion of privacy.  A
very enjoyable evening.
<P>
<B>New T-shirt</b><BR>
I now have a new SourceForge T-shirt that arrived the other
day.  Giving feedback can be worthwhile sometimes. :)
<P>
<B>Consluting</b><BR>
The work that I have been doing has started to dry up a
little, and my next project is due to start "any day now". 
It's been starting any day now for a few months, so I'm not
holding my breath on the timelines.  I'm very certain it
will happen because they've sunk so much work into it, I
just need the green light.  (Actually, I'm thinking of
starting work now and getting to the milestones a little
early.)
<P>
Been also calculating how much full-time work I'd need to do
at modest consulting rates in order to support myself for a
year.  If I wanted to take a bog-standard contract I could
live most comfortably working five months each year.  Whilst
working for five months at once is unattractive, the thought
of a seven month holiday without the thought of work is most
attractive indeed.
<P>
<B>House</b><BR>
Been looking at getting some repairs done to the house.  The
gutters need replacing before autumn/winter begins to rain
in earnest.   Having spoken to one particular builder about
how he can bring in approximately $AU450,000 tax-free in a
good year, I'm considering changing industries. :)
<P>
<B>Computer Security</b><BR>
One of my old old servers which I should have finished
decommissioning ages ago got cracked.  Still investigating,
but it looks like the other machines on my network are
unaffected.  I'm currently in the process of doing clean-up
and locking-down.  The machine in question that was
compromised is now removed from the network and will almost
certainly go into the spare parts cupboard.  The moral of
the story is (a) Don't get lazy because the O/S makes it a
pain in the arse to upgrade packages, and (b) Don't use an
O/S that makes it a pain in the arse to upgrade packages,
because you will get lazy.
<P>
Hooray for apt-get.  :)
