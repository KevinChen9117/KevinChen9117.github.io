<p><b>Back from Sydney, but first...</b><br />
I'm back from Sydney, and have many things to say about my adventures there.  But first I thought I would share a small but somehow amusing <a href="http://lists.slug.org.au/archives/slug/2005/09/msg00346.html">request for a new Perl keyword</a>, and its <a href="http://lists.slug.org.au/archives/slug/2005/09/msg00394.html">obvious solution</a>.
