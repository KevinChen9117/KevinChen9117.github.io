<B>Hackey-sack</b><BR>
The Vice-President of Marketing now plays hackey-sack.  This
is a good thing.  Mind you, it's not too surprising,
either.  AJ also plays Half-Life and Diplomacy.
<P>
<B>TPJ</b><BR>
Received an e-mail from Jon Orwant asking if I'd be
interested in writing an article for <A
HREF=http://www.itknowledge.com/tpj/>The Perl Journal</a>
about Finance::Quote.  I tried to send a more intelligent
reply than just "<I>Hell Yeah!</i>", which was my initial
response.
<P>
<B>Bugs</b><BR>
Damn hisenbugs resurrecting themselves.  Unfortunately
finding bugs that only occur "infrequently, and for no good
reason" is a very tricky process.
<P>
<B>Gardening</b><BR>
Compost heap is full.  A year's worth of hard work has
turned foodscraps and garden waste into a huge amount of
beautiful vermicast (worm poo).  The effects of this stuff
is impressive, but my supply outstrips my demand at my
current property (tiny back-yard).
<P>
I'd love to move somewhere with more space, but I don't want
to go from rented property to rented property.  This
probably means I should start looking at houses again, and
maybe re-evaluating my financial situation since Gwen is
living with us now.  Mind you, I have no idea how long Gwen
will be staying, so any calculations I make should err
strongly on the side of caution (then again, they always
do).
