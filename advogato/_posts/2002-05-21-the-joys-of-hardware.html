<b>The joys of hardware</b><br>
I've been hearing an odd sound in the office the last couple
of days. At first I thought it was the scanner, but it
continued to persist after the scanner had been turned off.
<p>
This morning, Jacinta remarked that she could distinctly
smell the odour of frying silicon.  That filled me with
dread, having already had two power supplies and a
hard-drive die in our main server over the last few years.
<p>
It ended up the problem was a CPU fan that was on the verge
of dying.  The smell was caused by dust that had burnt on
the heat-sink after the fan had stopped working.  An easy
enough job of swapping in a new CPU/fan.  The old CPU works,
but I don't have a replacement fan for it, and don't really
have a use for it otherwise.
