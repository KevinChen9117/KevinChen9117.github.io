<B>Work</b><BR>
Yesterday, Sharon "left", which is executive talk for being
made redundant.  Nothing was announced, and I thought the
only reason Sharon wasn't around was because she's in the
middle of her exam period right now.  What makes things
worse is that nothing was said in the staff meeting today,
it was only afterwards via e-mail that this was announced.
<P>
This is a very bad sign, and goes completely against our
"Company Values", which I feel some executives desperately
need to read.  It may well have been that Sharon wished to
move on anyway, but the way it was handled with the rest of
the company was awful.  A few months ago there would have
been cakes, drinks, proper announcements that someone was
leaving, speeches and thank-yous, and generally a chance for
everyone to wish them the best for the future.  I hope this
isn't the start of other employees "disappearing" with maybe
a short note on the news list to testify their passing.

<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
We finally have our <A
HREF="http://finance-quote.sourceforge.net">new webpage</a>
thanks to Ben.  It looks really pretty, although I've just
discovered that it's unreadable unless you have stylesheets
turned on.  The good news is that it looks fine in lynx.
<P>
Unfortunately, the page has very little in the way of
content, although this is not Ben's fault.  The <A
HREF="http://finance-quote.sourceforge.net/index.old.html">original
design</a> forwarded to me by Ben had lots more content, and
although it was true, it wasn't quite as appropriate.
<P>
Still haven't had a chance to hack at code yet.  Been too
busy with house matters.

<B>GnuCash</b><BR>
Showed Sofie GnuCash today, in exchange for a promised
massage for Jacinta and myself on the weekend.  Sofie claims
that she can probably skip most of her accounting homework
simply by typing it into GnuCash, and has asked me to
install it on her machine.

<B>Banks</b><BR>
All the banks seem to be happy to lend me much more money
than I want.  This is probably a good thing.
