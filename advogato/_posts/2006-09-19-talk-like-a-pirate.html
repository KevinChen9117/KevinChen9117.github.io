<p><b>Talk like a pirate</b><br />
Avast m'hearties.  It be <a href="http://www.talklikeapirate.com/piratehome.html">talk like a pirate day</a>, the one day ye can swig grog on the poop deck, play on yer hornpipe, and go sailing with ye mates.
<p>
If ye be looking fer others to be piratey with, ye may even drop into <a href="http://www.puzzlepirates.com/">Puzzle Pirates</a>.  I be <i>Tarrlox</i> on the <i>Sage</i> ocean, if ye wishes to say ahoy!

<p><b>New screen from Dell</b><br />
Dell seems to have a policy that one cannot transfer a 1 year USA warranty to another country, although one can update it to a 3 year international warranty.  If I go to the USA for laptop service, then everything is fine.  Otherwise, I'm out of luck.
<p>
I had a chat with Dell to say that it's not really fair that they reveal this only <i>after</i> I make a warranty claim, especially when there's no indication of this on their warranty transfer page, nor did they say anything when I completed the warranty transfer form.
<p>
Dell, quite graciously, agreed with my argument, and while they're not transferring the warranty, they are replacing the screen.  That's a great resolution for me, since the screen is probably worth more than the warranty, and it's all I really want out of this entire matter.
<p>
While I can't say that everything is hunky-dory until the screen is replaced, I'm certainly happy with how things have progressed so far.
