<b>Amusing Food</b><br/>
Found on the back of a Turkish delight packet:

<blockquote>
<p>
Turkish Delight is the pearl of the Desert Art and an old culture as old as Anatolian History.
<p>
Turkish Delight is a kind of food with sugar that can not be given up for people who live in Anatolia and foreigner who has a chance of tasting this desert once,
<p>
Turkish Delight was remembered with the MASTER who made it.
<p>
Recently, it is known with the brand of USAS.
<p>
One of the most important reason of this is our firm gives attention to hygiene while producing.  We take pains do not change its natural taste while adding flavour.
<p>
Turkish delight need some experience and discipline.  We add new sorts and tastes by day by and we proud of being primary and unique organization that has a studies of creating a clear situation for producing Turkish Delight.

</blockquote>
<p>
Well, I'm certainly relieved that Usas gives attention to hygiene while producing.

<b>Brewing</b><br/>
Pictures of our <a href="http://pjf.id.au/brew/brews/09_dandelion_wine.html">Dandelion Wine</a> are available.  It looks just like regular wine, only yellow.  Now we only have to wait another six months for it to mature.
