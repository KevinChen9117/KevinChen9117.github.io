<b>Vanity domains</b><br/>
I'm now the proud registrant of <a href="http://pjf.id.au/">pjf.id.au</a>.  Currently it just takes you to the PTA homepage, but it means that I now have a place to throw things that aren't really related to Perl Training Australia at all, like scuba-diving, edible flora, or beer-making.
<p>
It also allows me to golf myself an address that's shorter than my current CPAN address.
