<B>Hangover</b><BR>
David (my future brother-in-law-in-law) had his Buck's night last evening.  Tremendous fun, and a great way to relax after a hard working week, but with only one flaw.  Today's Friday, so the working week isn't over.  While I don't have a real hangover per se (drank plenty of water during the evening), I'm certainly functioning far below my usual mental capacity.

For some reason, my desire to listen to loud and repetitive techno is reduced.
