<B>Vegetable Thief</b><BR>
Caught the thief who's been stealing our vegetables, since she tried to come back and take our artichokes (which weren't even ready to pick yet), and our loquats (which needed another week of ripening).
<p>
We informed the thief in no uncertain terms that we were not impressed at her taking our produce without even the common courtesy of asking, and that no, we were not going to let take away what she had picked thus far.
<p>
I'm very annoyed, as we now have a number of fruit and vegetgables that really should have been left in for another week or two to fully mature.
<p>
Hopefully we can keep a vegetable garden that doesn't get plundered before the vegetables are mature from now on.
