<B>Banking</b><BR>
I got my card working.  It appears that my bank classifies
my account as a `cheque' account for ATM purposes.  I'm sure
that I'd pressed that button before, but the chances are
another part of my neural machinery corrected my request and
made me press `Savings', instead, because that's what I
always press.
<P>
I now have access to more than $11.90 in cash, and the
coffee is still very good.
<P>
<B>That's not a weed, it's a feature</b><BR>
I'm still surprised at the large untapped and tasty food
supplies we have growing around us.  A large number of tasty
and nutritious plants are hardy and quick-growing.  So hardy
and quick-growing that our society regularly sprays them
with herbicides, roots them up from the ground, or otherwise
tries to eliminate their existance.
<P>
It's hard to go far in Melbourne without encountering
<I>blackberry nightshade</i>, a small plant related to
tomatoes with clusters of small, black, sweet berries and
edible (when cooked) leaves.  The trainline near my house
regularly grows clumps of <I>salsify</i> (aka `oyster
plant') which has tasty young leaves, and a delicious and
thick root similar in size to a large carrot.  I'm drinking
a tea made form it now, but I've also had it in stir-fried
with noodles, and it is positively delicious. 
Unfortuanately, the train lines seem to be sprayed
regularly, making them unsuitable for foraging.  :(  This is
a shame, as I've spotted a relative of the <I>bush
banana</i> growing along the tracks as well.
<P>
The <I>fat-hen</i> in my backyard is going to seed, and has
attracted large numbers of small, seed-eating birds.  This
marvelous plant grew by itself, received no care, watering
or attention, regularly had large chunks pulled off to be
eaten in soups or omlettes, and eventually managed to grow
taller than the house with never a single pest.  The
neighbours chopped the top off it from over the fence
because they found it ugly.  I wouldn't have minded that too
much if they had eaten their harvest rather than left it.
<P>
On reflection I'm very happy with my garden.  It gets either
ignored or eaten, and yet it continues to grow more yummies
without any input from myself.  I don't even need to plant
seedlings, as most of the plants are self-seeded.
<P>
For those interested in further reading on happy gardens and
yummy weeds, I'd recommend <I>Permaculture One</i> by Bill
Mollison et al, and <I>Edible Plants of Australia and New
Zealand</i> by Tim Low.
