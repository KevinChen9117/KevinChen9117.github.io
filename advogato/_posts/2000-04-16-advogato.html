<B>Advogato</b><BR>
Like <A HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/ajv/>ajv</a>,
I've been dumped back to Observer status again.  I'm getting
a little used to this funny certification thing now -- it
seems to come in waves.
<P>
<B>Rockclimbing</b><BR>
Went with Ian, Benni and Dan (not Dan from work) to <A
HREF=http://www.themill.com.au>The Mill</a>.  The people
were very nice, some of the walls were fun, but I'll admit
that <A HREF=http://www.hardrock.com.au>Hardrock</a> remains
my favourite.  Still, The Mill is an easy bike-ride from
where I live (as is <A
HREF=http://www.vicranges.com.au>VicRanges</a>), whereas
Hardrock is yonks away.
<P>
In what appears to be a common occurance, I met up with some
old people I knew while Rockclimbing and got talking.  One
of them happened to do a study of one of Schoolsnet's
products as part of his thesis, and has promised to pass his
research on to me.  I look forward to reading it.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
It was a weekend, but nobody seems to have told Scotty
that.  I received two phone-calls from Scott about some data
conversion scripts I had written.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
The <A HREF=http://www.asx.com.au/>ASX</a> seems to have
broken their on-line share prices, which explains why some
of my regression tests were failing.  I've been doing a lot
of thinking about the module, but not a lot of coding.  The
code needs more ways to signal that something has gone
wrong, and what that wrongness is.
<P>
Played a little with Perl/Tk, but not seriously.  I'd like
to have a nice stock-ticker, but I don't want to write it
myself.  The tickers which I've played with didn't support
Australian stocks very well.
