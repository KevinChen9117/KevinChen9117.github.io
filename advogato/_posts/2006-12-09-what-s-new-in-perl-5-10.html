<p><b>What's new in Perl 5.10</b><br />
The slides from my talk are now available at the <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/talks/">Perl Training Australia talks page</a>, and can be modified and distributed under the terms of Perl itself (see the license at the end of the presentation).
<p>
<p><b>OSDC, day 3 + aftermath</b><br />
For a good description of talks and events, see <a href="http://use.perl.org/~cog/journal/">cog's journal</a>.
<p>
Day 3 of OSDC involved me giving my talk on <i>Human Interfaces for Geeks</i> which was extremely well received, especially if the number of drinks purchased for me at the pub are anything to go by.  Thank-you, everyone.
<p>
An especially big thank-you goes to Jarkko Hietaniemi, who patched <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Acme::Ook">Acme::Ook</a> with less than 24 hours notice to assist me in writing a lightning talk.  The result was <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Acme::OSDc">Acme::OSDc</a>,  a module to compile and run a language presented by Jon Oxer (of Linux Australia fame) in the lightning talks the day before.
<p>
In true OSDC fashion, the entire module was written "live" on-stage in less than 5 minutes.
<p>
After the conference we went to a pub, and then another pub, and then a bar...  You probably get the idea.  Currently Randal and cog are visiting <a href="http://www.zoo.org.au/visiting.cfm?zoo_id=2">Healesville</a> with Scott and Amanda, and I'm sure are having a great time.   However with 37'C temperatures (98.6'F) I imagine they'll be spending a lot of time in the shade.
