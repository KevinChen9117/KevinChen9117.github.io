<B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
Both Schoolsnet games are up and running now, and it's been
lots of fun to watch.  I'm still surprised at how eager
everyone was to join and how quickly the games were started.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Moving to the new building at the end of the week. 
Hopefully we might have air-conditioners there, as I'm
finding the temperature in my office quite a bit high for my
liking.  It also looks like I'll get a beautiful view as
well.
<P>
It looks like I'll be sharing an office with <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/scottp>Scottp</a>, which
will make things interesting.  Not because there's anything
wrong with Scott, but because he's so valuable and in
demand, so I expect there'll be a lot of traffic through the
office.  I've also been known to generate a bit of traffic
with people reporting bugs, CVS issues, and other things.
<P>
Justin shall be posted at the door to try and stem the tide
of people.  He's rehearsing his line now -- "None shall
pass!".
<P>
<B>Gwen</b><BR>
Gwen's been a little angel.  I came home last night and
found that she had washed all the dishes.  Washing dishes is
my most hated chore, so I'm <I>very</i> thankful to Gwen for
this favour.  It looks like we'll be getting along well. 
She even said that she liked my cooking.
<P>
<B>Ian</b><BR>
Benni calculated how much Ian is paying for his new car on a
"per week" basis.  It's about twice what I pay in rent,
although I don't think he's planning to live in his car.
<P>
Ian's been claiming that the real reason he purchased the
car is that there are better seltbelts for me in the
back-seat.  (When there are five people in Ian's car, I
usually volunteer to sit in the middle at the back, between
any cute girls that might be in the same car.)  While I
think this is very kind of him, I'm surprised that he didn't
just give me $20,000 and keep the change for himself.  I'm
surprised at how generous he is.
