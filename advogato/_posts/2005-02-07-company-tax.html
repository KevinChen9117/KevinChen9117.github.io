<b>Company Tax</b><br/>
Our company tax return is only four pages long, so at a glance it looks like it should be fairly straightforward.  The booklet on how to fill it in is only 116 pages, most of which doesn't apply to us; that's even better.  It's only once you realise that the booklet is simply a <i>reference</i> to a great many rulings, fact sheets, case files, laws, and other publications that it becomes apparent that everything is not quite as straightforward as it first seems.
