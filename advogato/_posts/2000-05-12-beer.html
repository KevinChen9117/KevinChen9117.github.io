<B>Beer</b><BR>
I'd like to drink a toast to whoever invented beer.  It's
very good stuff.
<P>
<B>Music</b><BR>
Music's good.  Especially with beer.
<P>
<B>Weekends</b><BR>
Weekends are great, especially with beer and music.
<P>
<B>Music again</b><BR>
Am considering stealing Dab's sub-woofer so my music sounds
better when I drink my beer.
<P>
<B>Coding</b><BR>
Together with Ian, we are drunkards@atcafe.com.au.  I've
learnt not to code when I'm drunk, because I think I'm a
legend and instead I write really obscure code with no
comments.  This is bad.  I should play Homeworld instead.
<P>
<B>Homeworld</b><BR>
I suck at Homeworld.  I'll probably suck at it more when I'm
drunk, but that's okay.
<P>
<B>Gwen</b><BR>
Gwen washed the dishes and gave me more games to play.  She
rocks.
<P>
<B>Ireland</b><BR>
Ireland has good beer and good music.  I love Ireland, and
have ancestors who came from there.  If people invaded
countries because they had good beer instead of oil, then
Ireland would be screwed.
<P>
<B>Food</b><BR>
I'm going to have to cycle more.  Food is one of those
wonderful necessities which I really love.  Back when I
cycled 30+km/day I could eat at much as I want.   I really
liked that.  Maybe I should give up work and cycle lots. 
Great Ocean Road sounds good, the Roadhouse at Laver's Hill
has such nice people, and such good food, and food tastes so
much better when you've been cycling up some huge mountain
all day. Maybe I should ask Schoolsnet if I can get my seat
replaced with a exercise bike, so I can burn more calories
while coding.  In fact, that sounds like an excellent idea. 
Mmmmm......  Calories.  Yum.
