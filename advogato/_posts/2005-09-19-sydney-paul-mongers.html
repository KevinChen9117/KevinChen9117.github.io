<p><b>Sydney Paul Mongers</b><br />
I'm heading up to Sydney to present some training courses, and as it happens I'm lucky enough to have this coincide with the local <a href="http://sydney.pm.org/">Sydney.PM</a> meeting.  I got lucky and caught Sydney.PM the last time I was in Sydney, and also the time before that, and the one even earlier.  Despite living in Melbourne, I consider Sydney.PM to be oen of my local perl user groups.
<p>
I'll be presenting at the upcoming meeting, with a slightly extended version of my <i>Mind Control</i> talk from SAGE-AU 2005.  Attendance is free, so feel free to drop around if you're in the area.

At the heart of any good conference are its presenters.  To learn new skills and
discover new ideas are what conferences are all about &mdash; at least that's what
you tell your boss when you apply for funding.  Presenting is a rewarding, and
often prestigious activity, but some speakers seem to do it better than others.
<p>
Paul Fenwick shares his experiences of almost a decade of teaching and public
speaking.  Discover how to keep your audience's attention, how to improve your
presentation techniques, and how to use mind control to get others to do your
bidding.
