<B>Course development</b><BR>
Work doesn't get much better than this.  I'm listening to some superbly remixed tunes (thanks <a href="http://di.fm/">di.fm</a>), drinking a hot cup of english breakfast tea, relaxing comfortably in my bedroom with a cute rabbit to keep me company while I prepare slides and play with Google's image search to find strange and interesting images.
