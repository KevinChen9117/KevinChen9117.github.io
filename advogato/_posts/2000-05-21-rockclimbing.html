<B>Rockclimbing</b><BR>
Made the trip over to Nunawading for some good climbs, and
good climbs they were.  I've really noticed my technique
improving, which is good.

<B>Work</b><BR>
I'm in at work bright and early.  I was the first developer
in.  This is mainly because Ian gave me a lift and usually
gets to work before I wake up in the morning.
