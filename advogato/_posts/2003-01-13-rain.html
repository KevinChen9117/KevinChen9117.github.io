<B>Rain</b><BR>
None. Nil.  Nada.  Zero.  Zilch.  Victoria is in heavy drought right now.  Water restrictions are in place, and there's no indication they'll stop anytime soon.  We have a 1000 litre rainwater tank for gardening and livestock, so keeping our trees alive doesn't place any additional burdens on our resevoirs.  Unfortunately, the tank is becoming rather empty, and the days are <i>very</i> hot and dry.  I'm really hoping we get some rain soon, but the <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/">BOM</a> doesn't thik that's likely in the next week.

<b>Cereal Toys</b><br>
Once upon a time, when you opened your box of corn flakes, you might get a little plastic truck or aircraft.  Yesterday I got a <i>Age of Empires</i> complete game on CD in the cereal box.  There was a huge shelf of them.  Looks like the cereal manufacturer thinks they can sell more boxes if they put games in them, and the whole box and game intro pushes hard about how good the game expansion is, and why you should buy it.
<p>
Mind you, I'll admit the game's been more fun than a plastic truck.

<b>Toys</b><br>
Lots of toys arrived today.  I now have much more desk space, and a <i>huge</i> bed with a 15 year warranty.
