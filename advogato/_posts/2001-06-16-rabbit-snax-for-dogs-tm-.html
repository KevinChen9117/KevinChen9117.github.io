<B>Homebrew</b><BR>
We've drunk about 50% of our first batch of beer, and that a
lot of it was before the three weeks of aging has something
to say for its quality.  Our brewed lemonade has just been
bottled, and we now have a cider bubbling away in the
fermenter which will be ready for bottling in a couple of weeks.

<B>Consluting</b><BR>
Yup, I'm still a conslutant.  Doing some work for some most
excellent people who I used to work with at schnet.

<B>Games</b><BR>
Had a bit of a play on the Sullon Zek Everquest PvP server.
 Very different to regular PvE play, and a hell of a lot of fun.
