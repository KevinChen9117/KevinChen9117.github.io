<B>Hardware</b><BR>
Found the problem with the scanner.  It had changed from /dev/sg1 to /dev/sg0, and apparently the snapscan driver wants the device mentioned explicitly in it's own special config file in order to work.  *shrug*

<B>Trademarks</b><BR>
Found on the back of a candy wrapper (capitalisation adjusted):
<blockquote>
Cadbury, dairy milk, the glass and a half device, magical elves and the colour purple are Cadbury Ltd trademarks and used under license in Australia by Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd.
</blockquote>
A trademark on the colour purple?  I wonder what the magical elves(TM) have been handing out to the trademark office?
