<p><b>Perl 5.11.1</b><br>
I've been behind in my blogging; time seems to fly when one is having fun, and I've been having a pretty good time recently.  Most of it's involved working with people and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pfenwick/sets/72157622533258381/">science</a>, rather than technology.  After I finish my taxes (not yet overdue), this may change.
<p>
In the meantime, I can't go without mentioning that <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=09/10/21/1439243">Perl 5.11.1</a> has been released.  This isn't a stable version of Perl, but it's a point release on the way toward 5.12.0.  I'm quite excited about 5.12.0 for many reasons I'll go into later, but they all involving modernisation of the language.
<p>
Of note in 5.11.1 (and hence 5.12.0) is that deprecation warnings are turned on by default.  This isn't scary; it means that if you've got old code that's going to break in the future, then Perl will start warning you about that well in advance.
<p>
Of other note is a minor point, and that's the ability to include version numbers in package declarations.  One can now write <tt>package Foo::Bar 1.23</tt>, rather than having to do cumbersome things with the <tt>$VERSION</tt> package variable.
