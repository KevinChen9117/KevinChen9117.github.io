<p><b>Poaching</b><br/>
I'm currently in the quite surprising position of being actively poached by a high-profile, international company; quite out of the blue.  At first I thought they had simply contacted a number of Perl-related people, since there was mention that the job would involve relocating to Seattle, and surely nobody would expect me to do <i>that</i>.  I wrote a polite letter to say that I was really quite happy managing <a 
href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a>, and that I'd need a very compelling reason to consider moving.
<p>
I realised that the company was actually serious when I received an international phone-call shortly afterwards, asking what salary I considered compelling.  I didn't have a good answer to that: the idea of leaving my business and lifestyle to move far away from friends and family is almost unimaginable.  Mix into this the apparent eagerness my potential poacher has for software patents, and it's pretty clear I'll need a lot of convincing.
<p>
There'll no doubt be more discussions on this matter, and I'm curious to see how it progresses.
