<p><b>Higher Order Perl</b><br/>
MJD's new book, <i>Higher Order Perl</i>, has been published.  MJ's <a href="http://perl.plover.com/hop/">page on the book</a> recommends buying from Powells.com.  It looks like this was a popular choice, as when I tried to place my order for a container of books I was informed that only three were left.  Maybe it has something to do with the sale price they're offering.
<p>
Those three books are now due to arrive in Australia in a few weeks time, and two of them will probably go to lucky course attendees.
<p>
I'd love to find an Australian distributor for <i>Higher Order Perl</i>.  While I've got the appropriate contacts for O'Reilly and Manning, I don't for Morgan Kauffman.
