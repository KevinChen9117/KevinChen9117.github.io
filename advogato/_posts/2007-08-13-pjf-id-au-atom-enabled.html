<p><b>pjf.id.au ATOM enabled</b><br />
In an attempt to make <a href="http://technorati.com/blogs/pjf.id.au/blog">technorati</a> hate my blog less, I've added an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATOM_(standard)">ATOM</a> feed to <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/">pjf.id.au</a>.  This was reasonably easy using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?XML::Atom::SimpleFeed">XML::Atom::SimpleFeed</a> once I realised that despite the fact that lots the fields in ATOM are optional, most readers <i>really</i> want them to be there.
<p>
The ATOM feed is also allegedly exporting tags, although I haven't seen any reader currently pick up on them.  Either I'm using the wrong readers, or I'm doing something wrong in the export.  I don't know yet.
<p>
The ironic thing is that despite this making my blog extra swishy in every other reader, technorati still seems to think it has only one post, and links that to the wrong page.  I'm hoping that the posting of new content (and a ping) will help it realise things are different now.
