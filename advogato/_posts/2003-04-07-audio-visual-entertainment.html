<B>Audio-Visual Entertainment</b><BR>
After having a DVD drive installed in <I>cube</i> (a tiny machine about the size of a shoebox) for a while, I actually used it to watch a movie.  Jacinta received a copy of <I>Spirited Away</i> for her birthday, and I was surprised at how easy it was to get everything running under Linux.
<P>
I spent about 15 minutes upgrading the drive's firmware, apt-get installed <a href="http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/groups/dvd/">Ogle</a>, dropped in the disk, and it played.  Woo-hoo!
<P>
Having a open-source operting system with an open-source DVD player work "out of the box" was deeply satisfying.  The only thing that didn't work was the TV output, but our 17" LCDs give a pretty nice picture, and are easily relocated to the lounge-room.
<P>
As it so happens, I remember getting the TV output working for a course I ran the other year where my only "projector" was a TV.  I'd just forgotten I needed to run the appropriate utility.  Oops.
<p>
In any case, I'm chuffed that our little shoebox performed its first test as an A/V machine admirably.  Now if I can only replace the fan in the power-supply that sounds like a failing lawn-mower, we might use it more often for home entertainment.
