<b>Homebrew</b><br/>
In an effort to put my vanity-domain to good use, I've created <a href="http://brew.pjf.id.au/">brew.pjf.id.au</a> to track my homebrewing efforts.
<p>
Nothing too exciting, but a lot more useful than a logbook I keep losing, and I can get HTML::Mason to do all the difficult calculations for me.
<p>
The navigation on the site needs to be improved.
