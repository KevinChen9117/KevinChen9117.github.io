<B>Rabbit</b><BR>
Shadow's delightful and friendly and still mostly litter
trained.  He enjoying playing with hair, ariel manuvers,
high-speed laps around difficult obsticles, and bananas.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Gmail has started at last. First invoice is away and coding
has begun.  Oddly enough, I still haven't managed to get out
of the requirements documentation.  I'm now in the process
of designing the stats reporting system (seem familiar?).
<P>
<B>Open Source</b><BR>
F::Q is way overdue for a new release, with plenty of new
code having been submitted a number of old bugs fixed up. 
After this release I'm looking at changing the way we
distribute the package and supporting files.  Most of the
"quotelets" can be distributed and upgraded seperately,
which will make bugfixing and maintainence easier (don't
need to release the entire package whenever the ASX change
their website).
<P>
Desperately want time to work on the work-tracking system
for <A HREF="http://www.obsidian.com.au/">Obsidian</a>.  I
estimate that I need about a 180 hour day to clear out my
backlog of higher-priority tasks.  Argh.
<P>
<B>Gardening</b><BR>
Have a 1/2 share mulcher with our <A
HREF="/person/kevinl">neighbours</a>. Have mulched stuff in
yard, but need to mulch more.  Now have more than 20 fruit
trees and vines, including:

<B>Homebrew</b><BR>
It's all <a href="/person/benno/">benno</a>'s fault.  Have brewed up 20l
of "Coopers Sparkling", and have 20l of home-made lemonade
in the fermenter now.  That the beer was drinkable both warm
and flat has much to be said for its quality.
<P>
<B>Business</b><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.obsidian.com.au/">Obsidian</a> is happy
and still turning a profit.
