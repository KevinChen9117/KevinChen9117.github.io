        <b>The night before OSDC</b><br/>
        Well, this is it.  After many months of planning, OSDC
        (aka YAPC::AU) is finally happening, tomorrow.  The committee
        will be starting setup at 7am, and that includes Jacinta and
        myself.  Tomorrow will be ending after the dinner, I'll
        be drinking a lot of coffee tomorrow.
        <p>
        Today was spent doing day-before setup at the facility,
        putting up signs, installing computers, and testing that
        <i>Frozen Bubble</i> works on the huge overhead projectors
        with thumping sound systems.  Perhaps I could challange
        Damian or Gnat to a game of Frozen Bubble as a lightning
        talk?  Perhaps all the stress of conference organising
        is finally sending me fruity.
        <p>
        For my part, I have everything ready, except for the traditional
        things, like my presentation and keynote introductions.  At
        least this is one conference where I won't need to pack a huge
        box of business cards -- as
        <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a>
        are sponsors, everyone will be getting a business card in their
        conference pack.
        <p>
        I've got a bunch of photos of setup and organisers (while
        they're still smiling!).  They'll be going up when I get a
        a free moment with connectivity and no pressing tasks.
        <p>
        <b>Scuba Gear</b><br/>
        Big box of scuba gear arrived the other day.  Getting it
        through customers was interesting, they wanted to know
        what a 'tank bhan-ger' was used for.  Eventually (when I found
        my order sheet) I realised it was a 'tank bang-er'.  After
        a few more difficulties (why would you want to bang your tank?)
        I communicated it was an underwater signalling device,
        <p>
        After the conference I'm looking forward to popping down to
        Portsea for a day or two in order to test out all the new
        gear.  We've got some wonderfully over-engineered lights
        (primary filament, backup filament, backup light, and locator
        light), so I'm really looking forward to a night dive if
        we can squeeze one in.
