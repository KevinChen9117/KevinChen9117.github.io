<p><b>No free time</b><br/>
Up until about 5pm today my April calendar was surprisingly free.  This is very rare.  Normally having a free day or week is pretty amazing, let alone an entire <i>month</i>.  I had planned to catch up on all those things that I consider overdue &mdash; the business paperwork, scuba equipment servicing, buying a wetsuit, harvesting wild plants, investment decisions, writing articles and courses, recreational programming, and a good deal of relaxation.
<p>
At 5pm a nice client called and asked if they could book me for the next four weeks.  There's a few executive decisions that need to be made their end, but there's an excellent chance that it will go ahead.
<p>
The way I figure it is that I'm exchanging one month in return for sufficient funds for five <i>perpetual days</i>.  Put another way, this potential month of work means I can five days a year less each year for the rest of my life.  That's pretty good.
<p>
My next free period is in October, which we have been planning for a holiday since last year.

<b>Diving</b><br/>
Have at least one, and hopefully two, weekends of diving coming up.  This will probably be our last chance to go diving in Melbourne before it gets too cold.  I'm a little envious of our friends with drysuits who can brave Melbourne's cold waters all year round.
