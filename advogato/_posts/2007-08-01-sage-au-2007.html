<p><b>SAGE-AU 2007</b><br />
Last week was the <a
href="http://www.sage-au.org.au/display/SAGEAU/Home">Fifteenth
Annual Australian System Administration Conference</a>, aka
SAGE-AU 2007.
<p>
Before I say more about the conference, let me mention the
conference dinner.  SAGE-AU conference dinners come with an
open bar; and not just beer and wine, either.  If you're
willing to go to the effort of walking to the bar you can
get some quite snazzy (and strong) drinks.  As you can
imagine, there's a tendency for the conference delegates to
get quite happy as part of the evening festivities.  The
reason why this is important is due to my role in the
conference each year.
<p>
Each year, for the last three years, I have been given
<i>the first talk after the conference dinner</i>.  Out of
all the talks at the conference, mine is the one conference
delegates are most looking for an excuse to miss.  I need to
have a talk that a room filled with hung-over sysadmins can
grasp and find entertaining.
<p>
This by itself is not a great challenge.  Where things
become really tough is that I'm invariably presenting the
talk with a hangover myself.  As can be seen from the <a
href="http://www.sage-au.org.au/download/attachments/2669/SAGE-AU-07-Day5-01.jpg">conference
photographs</a>, I've never got the habit of leaving the
dinner early.  It doesn't help that I feel compelled to rise
before the sun to do dry runs of my talk, either.
<p>
Despite all this, I'm very happy with the arrangement.  Not
because of the honour of being deemed worthy of dragging the
conference out of bed.  Not because of the invariable praise
and invitations that comes from a successful presentation. 
Not because of the perks that come with being a speaker, or
the feeling that I've imparted valuable knowledge to the
audience.
<p>
No.  The thing that really, really makes me feel wonderful
is watching the pain and anguish suffered by the delegates
who slept in and missed <a
href="http://www.sage-au.org.au/display/conf/An+Illustrated+History+of+Failure">the
talk</a>, and then are repeatedly told by their colleagues
how good it was.  There's something about getting up before
the sun with a hangover that really improves one's
appreciation of <a
