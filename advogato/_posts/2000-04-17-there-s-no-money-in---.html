<B>There's no money in...</b><BR>
Considering all the areas which "there's no money in", I
seem to be doing particularly well from them all.  I work
for a company which supplies education-targetted services
(and there's no money in education), and very recently I've
been offered the filthy lucre for hacking and extending
Finance::Quote (and there's no money in open source).

<B>Skirmish</b><BR>
Benni and Dan have organised a Skirmish (paint-ball) game
next week.  Everyone I've spoken to who's played it before
has said that it's the best fun you'll ever have, and you'll
get more bruises than you've ever had too.  It should be
interesting.
