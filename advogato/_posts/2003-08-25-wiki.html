<B>Wiki</b><BR>
Yup, adding a Wiki was a good idea.  Also, as there's been many requests by the players in the game, the ToEEwiki for the RPG I've been recently running has a <a href="http://toee.perltraining.com.au/pub/">public mirror</a>.  You may find it amusing if you know the players in the game, the most amusing part of the site are the character diaries.

<B>Business</b><BR>
Is good, and busy, as always.  After <i>much</i> negotiation I've managed to bring another software engineer on-board to help out with our workload.  I'm very excited about this, even though the business will only have her on a part-time basis.  I've also found a few suitable people who I can outsource to, so I'm hoping that things will quieten down as the wedding approaches, even though <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia's</a> throughput is increasing.

<B>Training</b><BR>
In negotiation with some other organisations to provide extensive training over the coming financial year and beyond.  Very exciting stuff.

<B>Trees</b><BR>
A wattle tree in the front yard fell over.  Just walked out to get the mail, and there it was, lying on its side.  It missed the house, missed the vege-patch, and missed the fence.  Very considerate of it.  Now we just have to remove it and tidy it up.
