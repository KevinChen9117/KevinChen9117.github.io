<P><B>Training</b><BR>
Currently I'm working full-time on training related activities.  I'm
writing this from Canberra, where I'm providing training for a
government department.  Next week I'll be in Manukau, New Zealand,
on another government assignment.
<P>
During the time when I'm not in front of a class presenting, I'm
writing or reviewing coursework, as we have new courses scheduled for
release with very inflexible deadlines.  It's certainly left me
with much less sleep than I would prefer.
<P>
However, my efforts are quite small compared to Jacinta's efforts,
which have been nothing short of amazing.  Jacinta has been working
harder, longer, and more effectively than myself.  I'm very blessed
to have such a talented business partner and wife.

<p> <P><B>Social Networking</b><BR>
The <a href="http://www.cit.act.edu.au/">Canberra Institute of Technology</a>
are teaching their students Perl, and are using our
<a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a> course
notes as a basis for their course.  I arranged to drop in for a chat,
and found myself the centre of attention of quite a number of academics
who were all eager to learn of my ideas and opinions on a range of subjects.
Quite an ego-raising experience.
<P>
The visit also confirmed that our support for <a
href="http://www.sage-au.org.au">SAGE-AU</a> is being noticed, as half
the group I met with were also SAGE-AU members, and recognised me from
the discounts we offer to members, as well as from the mailing list
and conferences.
<P>
In other social networking activities I had a number of chats with the
manager of Clifton and Associate's Canberra offices, who is very clued
in technically.

<p> <P><B>Canberra</b><BR>
Canberra is so very different to Melbourne.  The shops close early.
The food outlets close early.  There appears to be no convenience
stores or supermarkets where I'm staying, which is in the centre
of town.  Almost everyone is involved in the government in some way,
which I suppose isn't surprising.  Canberra is Australia's capital and
the seat of the federal government.

<p> <P>
One of the running jokes is that you know when you're in Canberra when
you meet a nice person at a party, and when you ask "So, what do you
do?", they respond with "I'm sorry, but I can't tell you that."
That's exactly the sort of response I've been receciving all week.
While my students can tell me where they work, and general job roles
(developer, sysadmin, coffee boy, etc), anything beyond that can only
be couched in the most general of terms.

<p> <P>
<B>Course Results</b><BR>
It appears that all my teaching was very well received.  Applause at
the end of the class and an invitation to come down to the pub with
the attendees is a clear sign that the course was thought of as
worthwhile.  Once again I received the feedback that 'it was good to
have such a knowledgable trainer'.  I'm a little disturbed that other
organisations may use trainers that <i>aren't</i> experts in their
field, but it appears to be a very common occurance.

<p> <P>
A number of students have expressed a desire for me to return to give
more advanced training, so I believe there'll be some requests up the
management chain to do so.  I'd be more than happy to return, teaching
a good class is a real pleasure.
