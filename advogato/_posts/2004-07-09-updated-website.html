<B>Updated Website</b><BR>
For the new financial year, <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a> has a new special offer.  Customers who book and pay for their course before the early bird special date will receive <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/books.html">free perl books</a>.

Many thanks to Jacinta who spend a good part of the day stuffing book information into the XML files that are used to generate our website.

<B>Sick Machines</b><BR>
Looks like the machine I just refurbished was in the spare room because it occasionally turns itself off or on with no good reason.  I suspect it's the power supply.  That makes it not particularly useful.

Looks like I may be getting a virtualizer after all.  Much less time and money than yet another machine.
