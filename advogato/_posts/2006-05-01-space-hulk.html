<p><b>Space Hulk</b><br />
When I was much younger I spent some time playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Hulk">Space Hulk</a>, a boardgame by Games Workshop set in the Warhammer 40k universe.
<p>
Unfortunately Space Hulk is well out of print, and Games Workshop themselves describe the game as <a href="http://us.games-workshop.com/games/40k/gaming/spacehulk/default.htm">long gone</a>.  One would think this would pose a challenge to a gamer who wants to play again, but doesn't own a set.  Thankfully, it doesn't.
<p>
Games Workshop have been wonderful people and made the <a href="http://us.games-workshop.com/games/40k/gaming/spacehulk/tiles.htm">old Space Hulk tiles</a> available for download.  Using a colour printer, a glue-stick, some cardboard, scissors and a lot of patience, I managed to put together my very own Space Hulk board pieces.
<p>
Armed with an inventory of what was originally in the box, I managed to find enough tokens from other games to use as blips, and a friend brought over a box of Hero Quest minatures and doors.  Combined with a compednium of old rules from another gamer, first edition Space Hulk lived once more!
