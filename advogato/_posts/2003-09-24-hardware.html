<B>Hardware</b><BR>
Hardware sucks.   Got some spangly new graphics card that's supposed to run like the wind, but it doesn't want to work with the old mobo.  Fine, muck around with hardware, put it into the new mobo (which will eventually go into one of our servers) and it works.  Good.  It's got a DVI output, and we have LCD screens.  Plug the two together, and I find a flickering bunch of crud with edge effects everywhere.  About to try it using the standard VGA connectors, but I thought DVI was supposed to give you a clearer picture, not a cruddier one.

Are lots of fun, and make a surprisingly good workout.

Is still happening, and requires far too much organisation.

<B>Staff</b><BR>
Usually I try to avoid poaching from my clients, as taking their good staff members doesn't always make them happy.  However I have one client who's offered to introduce me to some of their eligible and clueful staff members for poaching, no doubt to free up more of my own time to work for them.  I really am honoured, and think that it's a very strange world that we work in.

Are running dead-slow tonight.  Thank-goodness I can turn them off.
