<B>Hurrah!</b><BR>
Hurrah!  Advogato is back up.  Oh happy day!
<p>
While our favourite mouse has been away, I've been keeping <a href="http://use.perl.org/~pjf/journal">journal at use.perl.org</a>.  Now that advogato is back, I'll probably continue to write here, or (heaven forbid) cross-post to both.

<b>Silly Things</b><br>
I've discovered a <a href="http://www.kingdomofloathing.com/login.php">rather silly game</a> that contains many of the qualities of expensive MMORPGs, but with the convenience of running in a web-browser, and competely free.  The humour isn't half-bad, either.

I've finally got around to improving the navigation and many other nagging fixes on the public mirror of our <a href="http://toee.perltraining.com.au/pub/">Temple of Elemental Evil</a> wiki.

<B>End of Financial Year</b><BR>
Got all of our paperwork out for employees and their tax affairs out today.  Now I have only a quarter of personal and company paperwork to catch up on.  Hurrah.
