<B>General thoughts</b><BR>
I fear that my recent illness and interest in financial
material is not from natural causes, and may be related to
my recent abduction.
<P>
At first I thought the distorted sound, bright lights,
ghostly voices, and the distinct impression of an anal probe
were merely the side effects of eating extra-hot curry after
a few too many beers.  After some careful reflection I feel
that I cannot dismiss this incident out-of-hand, no matter
how normal and trivial it may seem to be.
<P>
My only vivid memories were that of <I>things</i> that were
humanoid in shape.  I distinctly remember one of them having
a beard, but did not catch sight of the rest of its face. 
They were wearing white lab-coats, did not speak, and
appeared to be drinking instant coffee.  I remember trying
-- without success -- to convince one of these creatures
that the ground coffee was much better, even if it took
longer to brew.
<P>
My next memory is that of waking the next morning with a
blocked nose and a strange desire to read <I>TaxPack
98-99</i>.  I suspect that I may be suffering from the
effects of mind-control, mood-altering drugs, or even DNA
manipulation transmitted through a virus vector.
<P>
The virus-vectored genetic manipulation scenario is
unlikely, but must not be ignored.  While I believe that I
am no longer contagious, I may have unwittingly affected
others with my illness.  This could prove disasterous, and
could cost the <A HREF=http://www.ato.gov.au>Australian
Taxation Office</a> hundreds of dollars in claims that
replacement nerf-darts and mini-pumpkins are work related
expenses.
<P>
I am investing in an <A
HREF=http://members.tripod.com/~zoam/afdb.html>Aluminium
Foil Deflector Beanie</a> to guard against mind-control, and
sipping lemon-and-honey to combat the mood-altering drugs
and sore throat.
<P>
<B>Work/GnuCash/Quote.pm</b><BR>
Nothing to report as my illness is adversely altering my
mental capacity to write code.  Will be spending the day in
bed.  <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/dancer>Dancer</a> was
kind enough to send me a get-well e-mail.  I'm glad to see
that my workmates care about my health and continued
well-being.
