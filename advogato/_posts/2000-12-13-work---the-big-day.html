<B>Work - The Big Day</b><BR>
Well, the big day approaches.  It's out on the grapevine
now, so I might as well place it in my diary.  I'm resigning
from my current employer to become a consultant.  The
reasons are long and varied, the one I most fond of goes
something like this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
I find I never have enough time in the day to do everything
I want.  The two things that take up the most time are work
and sleep, and I'm unwilling to give up sleep.

<P>
That sums it up nicely, I guess.  I want a life again. 
Currently I'm doing management work, not coding, not design,
not the things I'm good at, nor the things I want to be
learning.  Sure, I make a great catalyst.  My presence helps
everyone else do their jobs and work more effectively, but I
don't actually seem to get any work done myself because I'm
too busy shunting work.
<P>
Can I say I'm happy about leaving my job?  Well, I'm
certainly happy for me -- I've got plenty of people jumping
at the chance to grab me as a consultant, so I'm not too
concerned about not getting work.  Likewise, if things do go
badly I've got a good chunk of savings and a few standing
invitations to go back to full-time employment.  I stand to
gain a lot -- my home office is underneath an apricot tree,
I'll be working with some of the most clueful people I've
ever met, and there'll be opportunities for me to learn the
things I'm interested in and do the things I want to do. 
The risk is well worth the potential gain here.
<P>
However
there are some people I will miss, and who I know will find
things harder when I'm gone.  To those people, I'm sorry.  I
love working with you, you're great people, but I'm going to
go insane if I continue with things the way they are.  I'm
sure that we won't lose touch, in fact I very very much hope
that we can work together again in the future.
<P>
Right now I'm trying to write my final letter to submit on
Friday.  It's certainly not the easiest of tasks, and I'd
like things to go as smoothly as possible with me leaving.  
It won't go smoothly, of course, there's no denying that
I'll be leaving a rather large hole, but I'm hoping I can
put forward recommendations that will help.
<P>
It's getting late, and I should be getting home before
dark.  I'm sure I'll have much more to write before all of
this is over.
