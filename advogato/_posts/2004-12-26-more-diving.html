<p><b>More Diving</b><br/>
Leaving soon for my dive trip.  While performing pre-flight checks on all my equipment, I discovered a pressure gauge that rattled.  Now, most pressure gauges do rattle when they're not pressurized, but this one rattles noticably more.  It was working fine last time I dived, but maybe it got damaged in transport, or got dropped when it was in for servicing?  Maybe it's fine, and has always rattled like that.
<p>
Normally I would just cycle down to the nearest dive shop, have a chat to the staff there, pop the gauge onto a tank of air and make sure it gives a good reading.  Unfortunately, it's holiday season, and all the dive shops I could possibly reach are closed before I take off for a few days on a boat.
<p>
I'm going to contact the boat operator and ask if they can bring an extra set of regs, or just another pressure gauge, just in case this one is having problems.

Going to be a pain if the gauge is broken, luckily I believe I still have all the warranty papers to go with it.
