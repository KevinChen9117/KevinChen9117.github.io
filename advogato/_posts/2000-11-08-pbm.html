<B>PBM</b><BR>
Still have this weird desire to play really old PBMs that
don't seem to be around anymore.  I might well take up the
idea of re-coding the one I want to play most from memory in
C++, simply because I know just how long it's been since
I've really done anything in C++ and how rusty my skills in
that area have become.  Perl may be the swiss-army chainsaw
of the Internet, but that doesn't mean I can't get mental
RSI from using it.
<P>
