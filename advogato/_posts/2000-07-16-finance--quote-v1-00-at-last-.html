<B>Finance::Quote v1.00 at last!</b><BR>
At last Finance::Quote 1.00 has been released and is
available for public consumption.  Along with the new
release I've also updated the <A
HREF="http://finance-quote.sourceforge.net/">Finance::Quote
website</a>  so that it's not quite so content-poor.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.advogato.net/person/scottp">Scotty</a>
is right that it takes a fair bit of time to release a
project.  I spent the better part of an hour or two
uploading changelogs and writing announcements.
<P>
I guess now it's time for me to chase down Jon about that
Perl Journal Article.

Lost my extremely-good monk in ADOM because I wasn't
thinking.  If you ever come across a level filled with
corpses, you <I>should</i> be thinking "why are all these
monsters dead?" instead of thinking "buffet dinner" and
waiting for a banshee to sneak up and wail at you.

<B>Work</b><BR>
I've been most proud of young TIm, who's started the
conversion to full geekdom.   Tim's been staying back at
work much too late so that he can hack with his Linux
boxen.  There's been some talk of moving him into systems to
replace <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/rcp>Ross</a>.  I'm
hoping to throw Tim with a few programming texts before that
happens.  :)
