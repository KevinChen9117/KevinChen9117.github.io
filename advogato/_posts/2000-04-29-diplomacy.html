<B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
Wow!  13 people at work have told me they most certainly
want to play in a Diplomacy, and I'm sure that another one
will come out of the woodwork somewhere, giving us 14. 
That's enough for two standard games.  This is excellent, it
means I can play in one and GM the other.  I'm very much
looking forward to this.
<P>
Ross and Humpy also seem to be looking forward to the games
very much.  I think they'll show themselves to be excellent
players, which should make for an interesting game.

<B>Work</b><BR>
Back at work after a nice relaxing holiday.  I don't really
want to be back at work, I was just getting used to being on
holidays.

<B>Ian</b><BR>
Ian's just spent some ludicrous amount of money on a new
car.  His old car worked fine, the only problem seems to
have been that it had lost its `new' smell.
