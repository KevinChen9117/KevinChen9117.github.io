<p><b>University degrees</b><br />
I've been doing an awful lot of <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">teaching</a> these last few weeks, and part of it has made me think a little more about university degrees, and whether or not they're useful.
<p>
I had a great time at university, and am very happy with both what I had learnt in my degree and the social connections that I made.  However I also have a number of friends and associated who are very successful and skilled, but have no tertiary qualifications at all.  Indeed, my first year computer science teacher explained that if we <i>really</i> wanted to make money we should have left school at sixteen to become bricklayers.  There's a shortage of bricklayers, and by the time we would be graduating our bricklaying alter-egos would be running their own tax-effective business and own three houses.
<p>
So, is it really worthwhile spending three or more years of your life to get a piece of paper?  For the individual I really can't say, but for a trainer with a class filled with postgraduates, the answer is yes.  Hell yes!
<p>
My class of recent graduates learnt <i>much</i> faster than any other class I can remember.  We covered four days worth of material in a mere three days, and spent the extra day covering extra theory and object oriented design in Perl.  Regardless of the rewards to the attendees, it was a very rewarding experience for myself.
<p>
Now, it could just be luck that I had a particularly smart class, but I think the fact that most were fresh out of university was a factor.  If nothing else, holding a university degree shows that you know how to learn and absorb knowledge, and are able to adapt to new situations.  I know that should almost be self-obvious, but it's not something I had encountered in such a stunning way until recently.
<p>
<b>Perlish dreams</b><br />
I have strange dreams sometimes, and usually I forget them.  But last night's one stuck in my head.  I was at a conference, and <a href="http://pugs.blogs.com/pugs/">Audrey Tang</a> was giving a presentation.  Not just any presentation, but the best presentation I had ever seen in my life.  It was truly spectacular, and used many new presentation techniques I had never before encountered.
<p>
I was saddened by the end of the presentation, not only because it was so good, but because if I took my new-found techniques everyone would know that I lifted them directly from Audrey's keynote.  They just won't be as cool.
<p>
It took me 90 minutes after waking up to realise that the whole thing was a dream, and that I could use these great new techniques and have them appear original!
<p>
My happiness lasted but a few mere seconds before it also dawned upon me that unicode doesn't have <a href="http://www.frozen-bubble.org/">frozen bubble</a> glyphs.  And even if it did, "<tt>&amp;penguin; &amp;penguin; &amp;orangeball; &amp;igloo;</tt>" probably wouldn't be a valid Perl 6 program, regardless of how much cool stuff it did in my dream.
