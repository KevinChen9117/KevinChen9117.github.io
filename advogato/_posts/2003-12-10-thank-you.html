<B>Thank-you</b><BR>
I've had a great many kind people come out of the woodwork to offer their condolences and assistance after my mother passed away last Sunday.  While I have not had the opportunity to respond to most of the kind words that have been sent to me, they are all very much appreciated.  I am touched by the compassion of my friends and the community around me, and I am certain that my mother would be honoured by the incredible number of people who have expressed regret at her passing.

I was also sent a letter of condolence from a Nigerian scammer, who obviously got a copy of my 'out of office' message.  That provided me with some amusement for the morning.
