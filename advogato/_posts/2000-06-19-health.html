<B>Health</b><BR>
Woke up on Saturday with a bit of a sniffly nose.  Ignored
it for the day.  Woke up on Sunday with a more sniffly
nose.  I figured I wouldn't let a sniffly nose tell me what
to do, so I cycled 25-30km and then hauled myself up some
walls.  Interestingly enough this got rid of the sniffles
for a while.  Woke up this morning and the sniffly nose was
back, and it's currently being kept at bay with a mixture of
codeine and other chemicals, which have also dropped my
sensory perception significantly.
<P>
<B>Houses and stuff</b><BR>
Things seem to be going okay.  I'm awaiting a few
phone-calls from the banks to say that they like me enough,
and then I'll be making an offer on the property.  I'm
feeling a lot better about the whole thing now.  Even if we
don't buy the house I feel a lot better off for the
experience, knowing how everything works.
<P>
I'm sorry to hear that <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/ajv>ajv</a> is having
problems getting a home-loan.  If it's any help, the banks
seemed to be much happier when I mentioned that I was
poached by my current employer.

<B>Rockclimbing</b><BR>
Jacinta managed to climb the "training wall", which is the
first of the big walls out at Nunawading.  This is
excellent, and I'm very proud of Jacinta's efforts.  She was
rewarded with a free mexican meal.
<P>
<B>Fish</b><BR>
Dan Golembo was telling me about fish in Russia that are
harvested for "black caviar".  Apparently one of these fish
can contain as much as 100kg of caviar -- which makes it one
HUGE fish.  Unfortunately it seems that the fish are being
hunted to the brink of extinction, as the black caviar is
such a sought-after commodity, and their natural habitat is
becoming polluted.
<P>
Remind me not to wrestle any Russian fish in the future.
