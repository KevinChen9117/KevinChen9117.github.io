<B>Power failures</b><BR>
I'm glad I got the UPS talking to the server again, just had our second power-outage in twelve hours.  Looks like the big gusts of wind are wrecking havoc with the power-grid.  Last night's lightning probably didn't help either.
<p>
Everything is working just as it should.  The server continues running for five minutes in case things get better, and my workstation falls flat on its face but recovers quickly due to ext3.  It also recovers quickly because all the important stuff (such as /home) is mounted on the server.  Hurrah hurrah.
<p>
<B>Camels</b><BR>
<a href="http://www.theage.com.au/">The Age</a> newspaper had <a href="/person/scottp/">scottp</a> and myself out at the Vic Market with camels on Sunday, taking photos.  They're running a small article on <a href="http://melbourne.pm.org">melb.pm</a>.  It seems that camels <i>really</i> like Scott.  I'm hoping they'll publish a photo of the camel giving Scotty a big sloppy kiss.
<p>
<B>Work</b><BR>
AIIIIEEEEE!!!!  Just when you thought it couldn't get any busier, it does!  There's a good chance that myself and a client's ISP representative will be placed into the ring to fight it out regarding certain networking problems that they've been experiencing.
<p>
I'm looking forward to December <i>so much</i>.  Everyone goes on holiday in December, right?
<p>
<B>Trees</b><BR>
Some good friends dropped around a Hazelnut tree the other day, claimed it was an engagement present.  I love trees, and I love hazelnuts, so I'm very happy.

<b>Wireless</b><BR>
Have the antenna, have the card on-way.  Getting cables sorted out.  The card and antenna nicely works out to be just under the legal limits on power-output, handy that.
