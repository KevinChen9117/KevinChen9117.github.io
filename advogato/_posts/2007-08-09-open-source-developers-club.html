<p><b>Open Source Developers Club</b><br />
Last night we had another <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/osdclub/">Open
Source Developers Club</a> (OSDClub) meeting.  I had volunteered
my talk on <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/osdclub/200708/history_of_failure.html">An Illustrated History of Failure</a>, and
Simon Hildebrant had volunteered a talk on <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/osdclub/200708/selenium.html">Selenium</a>.
<p>
The night seemed to go well, but I can't help but be disappointed
with my performance.  I've been teaching all this week, and this
is extremely time consuming.  Waking up very early and then standing
in front of a class for eight hours can sure be tiring, but that's not
the real problem.  After a full day of teaching, the last thing I want
to be doing is spending an hour or more rehearsing my talk.  I'd much
rather be playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikmin">Pikmin</a> (thanks Ian!), or mucking
with <a href="http://technorati.com/people/technorati/pfenwick">technorati</a>, or even watching commercial TV.
This is especially the case when I've been teaching roughly every
second week for the last two months.
<p>
I hold myself to a particularly high standard when it comes to
presentations.  Presenting is my job, and if I flub my lines or
forget my slide order, then I'm extremely unhappy.  For anyone
who noticed my errors last night, I apologise.  For anyone who
didn't notice, thank-you.  You're a great audience.
<p>
Simon's presentation last night was on testing the web with
<a href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium/">Selenium</a>, which is an awesome tool, and which has lots of ways
to plug into TAP and other testing frameworks.  There were some
interesting ideas being thrown around about how one can use
Selenium to provide repeatable test cases for web applications,
the same way that one would provide test cases when submitting
a bug report for a traditional application.
<p>
The discussion got me thinking more about what if one finds a bug, but can't get it fixed.  It's a good introduction to my next talk, which is
<i>Fixing the web with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey">Greasemonkey</a></i>.
