<B>Business</b><BR>
I haven't checked the books, but I suspect that we've invoiced more in the last five months than we did for the entire 2002-2003 financial year.  Business is booming, although it means I have no time for the more plesant things such as recreational time.
<p>
Two out of three small business owners I've spoken to recently have found it difficult to find or keep good staff.  I'm finding the same.  The remaining one in three pays a highly-paid consultant to avoid their staffing difficulties.
<p>
Business has me travelling interstate regularly.  Last week was Canberra, this week and the next is Sydney.  Next year there's a trip to Brisbane, and that's one of the few business trips I'm actually looking forward to.
<p>
<B>ToEE</b><BR>
The <a href="http://toee.perltraining.com.au/pub/">ToEE wiki</a> has been improving significantly recently, primarily thanks to James, one of our players.  New features include a public guestbook, indexed blogs, new character portraits, humour, and much much more.
<p>
If you're the sort of person who enjoys reading about someone else's role-playing game, then you might even consider visiting.  The new <a href="http://toee.perltraining.com.au/pub/DiaryIndex.html">chronological character diaries</a> are well worth reading.
<p>
If you're interested instead in how Google can decide that all sorts of irrelevant cruft is considered to have a high page-rank because it's written in W3C compliant XHTML and is updated regularly, then our <a href="http://toee.perltraining.com.au/pub/ToeeHumour.html">humour page</a> has numerous and disturbing examples.
<p>
<B>Humour</b><BR>
On the topic of humour, Jacinta suggested that <a href="http://www.despair.com/consulting.html">this image</a> may be a good addition to our office.
<p>
I would like to point out that consultants from <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a> do an excellent job of solving client problems, and the previous link should be considered for its humour value only, and should not be taken to relate in any way to our business activities or professional ethics.
<p>
We make our money because our clients seem to have an inexhaustible list of desires, and they need someone to manage their other consultants.  ;)
