<p><b>OSDC 2006 recovery</b><br />
<a href="http://www.osdc.com.au">OSDC 2006</a> has ended, and I'm currently recovering.  I presented six talks in three days (four lightning, one single, and one double-length talk), met an incredible number of people, and had very very little sleep.
<p>
More thoughts will follow once I've recovered a little more.
