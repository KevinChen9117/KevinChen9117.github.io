<B>Losing Weight</b><BR>
After being weighed every time I donate blood, and noticing the steady upward trend on my weight every time I visit, as well as my pants being a little bit tight, I've decided to reverse the trend.  This isn't a matter of great importance, I'm right in the middle of the healthy weight range, instead it's a way of providing support to Jacinta (who's also losing weight), and saving myself from having to endure the dullness of purchasing new clothes.
<p>
A couple of weeks ago I was 71.5kg, now I'm 70.0kg.  My goal is to end up back at around 65kg, as that was my weight a couple of years ago, as well as still being comfortably within the healthy weight range.  Five less kilos also makes bicycling (particularly hill-climbing), and rock-climbing easier.
