<p><b>RateMySL - Rate My Second Life</b><br />
Now I'm finally up-to-date with my backblogging, I can write about what I'm doing right now.  My recent pet project has been <a href="http://ratemysl.com"/>RateMySL</a> aka <i>Rate My Second Life</i>, a distributed image voting system for <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/?u=a76c9554a1a1417aa74c240be05788b2">Second Life</a>, a virtual world that's recently been gaining a lot of publicity.
<p>
RateMySL uses a number of in-world voting panels to collect and relay information back to my real-world server, which in turn tallies the information and pushes scores back to scoreboards which are also located in Second Life.  The project is directly responsible for the <a href="search.cpan.org/perldoc?Voting::Condorcet::RankedPairs">Voting::Condorcet::RankedPairs</a> CPAN module, which it uses under-the-hood to generate scoring information.
<p>
When we released the system a few weeks ago we aimed to have more than 25 participants in the first month, which we're really considering our beta period.  While we've been successful in that regard, I believe that the mechanism currently used for vote collection is inheretly flawed, with determined individuals being able to unduly influence the ratings.  I hope to have it replaced in time for next month's contest.
