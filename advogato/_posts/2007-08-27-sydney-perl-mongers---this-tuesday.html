<p><b>Sydney Perl Mongers - This Tuesday</b><br />
I'm up in Sydney until the end of Thursday teaching our <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/courses/programmingperl.html">Programming Perl</a> course.  Tomorrow night (Tuesday 28th August 2007) I'll be presenting <i>an illustrated history of failure</i> at <a href="http://perl.net.au/wiki/Sydney_Perl_Mongers">Sydney Perl Mongers</a>  I'd love to see you there, even if you have absolutely no interest in Perl.
