<B>Telepathy Machine, Patent Number US05830064</b><BR>
Just saw <A
HREF=http://slashdot.org/articles/00/04/23/0946236.shtml>an
article on Slashdot</a> describing a <A
HREF=http://www.patents.ibm.com/details?pn=US05830064__>patent
on a mind-reading input device</a>, with literally no
strings attached.  The device relies upon the operator's
consciousness collapsing quantum wave functions in
detectable ways.  The patent makes for interesting reading,
and has references to a number of books and journal articles
that look as if they may be even more interesting.
<P>
If the reports from <A
HREF=http://www.princeton.edu/~pear/>Princeton Engineering
Anomalies Research (PEAR)</a> are actually real and
reproducable, then this is all pretty amazing stuff.  Humans
with psionic powers (natural or engineered) is the sort of
stuff I remember reading in old SciFi and Fantasy novels
during high-school.
