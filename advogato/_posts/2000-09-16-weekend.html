<B>Weekend</b><BR>
Nice long day.  Pottered around in the garden and grazed a
bit.  Soil life looks very happy and I found a couple of
unexpected carrots growing which I munched upon.  Moved lots
of silverbeet out of stasis (the cold pots in the corner) to
the main bed where it's warm.  Should keep me in leafy
greens for some time.
<P>
Inspected the house in Coburg again, and this time brought
along Jacinta's father as well to see if he could spot
things we didn't.  All up the house is indeed looking
promising, although I'm somewhat concerned that a Melbourne
Water service-hatch that is supposed to exist cannot be
found.  Will be chasing this with the relevant authorities.
<P>
Home proxy-server has a new hard-drive after I was left with
a couple spare after emergency upgrades the other weekend.

Oh goodness!  I have a couple of hours to work on Open
Source.  Going to try and squeeze out that long overdue
release.
