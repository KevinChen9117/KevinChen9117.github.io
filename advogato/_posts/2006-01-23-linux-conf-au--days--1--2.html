<p><b>Linux.Conf.au, days -1..2</b><br/>
I'm in New Zealand which is hosting the annual Australian
<a href="http://lca2006.linux.org.au/">Linux.Conf.au</a> (LCA).
It's in a lovely little town called Dunedin which all around
seems to be a great little place.  This is my first LCA, I'm
not presenting, so I'm still discovering what to expect and what not.
<p>
The first two days have been filled with "mini-confs", baby conferences
organised around particular themes.  Unsurprisingly, the highlight
so far has been the Conway mini-conf, where I was able to see Damian's
<i>Presentation Aikido</i>.  I was extremely pleased to see that
Damian's talk was quite different to MJD's and my own.
<p>
Other nice things about the conference so far have been the
accomodation (in-room ethernet), the breakfasts, and the
conference bag.  In fact, the conference bag is incredibly cool,
and is designed around holding a laptop and gadgets.
<p>
The big down-points have been the lack of easily accessible timetabling
information, the flakey network connectivity, and the quality of the
talks themselves.  It seems that I've had the misfortune to attend a
number of poorly prepared talks, but I'm confident that the main
conference will be of a higher quality.  There have also been some
very good ones; like many conferences the talk quality varies greatly.
<p>
My primary goal here is to meet <i>new</i> people, although I've been
having mixed results.  I think I'm going to have to engineer matters
to my favour, which means I'll try to kickstart a Perl BOF.  I'm
particularly interested in meeting any NZ Perl-mongers (I've already
bumped into a few).
