<p><b>Holy web 2.0 Batman!  I've been dugg!</b><br>
Woke up today to discover an unusually large number of comments on my talk on <a href="http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=8hghpuxCHTc">fixing the web with greasemonkey</a> posted to youtube.  I figured that the video had been indexed somewhere, similar to the rush of views it saw when it was submitted to <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/url/www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv=8hghpuxCHTc">stumble-upon</a>.
<p>
I discovered <a href="http://digg.com/software/greasemonkey_to_the_web_fixing_rescue">I'd been dugg</a>.
<p>
Quite amusingly rather than <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=525">my blog entry</a> on the talk being dugg, or my posting on youtube, it was a copy of the video on <a href="http://www.5min.com/Video/How-to-fix-the-web-with-greasemonkey-10537929">5min.com</a> that was getting all the attention.  I didn't even know 5min.com existed, or that my material had been posted there.  Regardless, I was happy for the attention.
<p>
With maybe 500 people in the audience at linux.conf.au, 8,500 hits on youtube, and 21,000 hits(!) on 5mins, I'm guessing I've managed to absorb more than <i>two person-months</i> of audience time.  For a three-and-a-half minute talk, I'm pretty pleased.
<p>
I've got a bunch of other talks I've been meaning to put on-line for a while now, but given the amazing response to this one, I think I'll be starting with my other lightning talks.
