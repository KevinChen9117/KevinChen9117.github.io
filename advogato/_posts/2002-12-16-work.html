<B>Work</b><BR>
Okay, this is getting ridiculous.  Months ago I briefly meet a sales rep from something like the world's second largest telecommunications corporation.  He takes great delight in telling me how fantastic his network is, how there are hundreds of engineers all working on it making sure that it's the best in the world.  And when he has a problem with a Linux proxy setup, who does he call...?
