<B>Hardware</b><BR>
I am truly sick of hardware.  Installed a new SCSI card today, but it doesn't want to talk to the tape-drive attached to it.  I suspect a termination problem, although it could be a BIOS problem on the card.
<p>
That in itself is okay.  It's that for some reason <i>xsane</i> now completely refuses to talk to the scanner on a <i>completely different</i> SCSI card that's incredibly frustrating.  Especially when sane-detect-scanner is convinced (and so am I) that the scanner is there and working perfectly.
