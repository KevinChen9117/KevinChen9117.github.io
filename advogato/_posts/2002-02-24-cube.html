<B>Cube</b><BR>
The new machine has been dubbed cube, due to its shape,
although it's more shoebox than cube proportioned.  Sound
under Windows was a right pain to get working, and involved
an upgrade from Win98SE to Win2K in order to get a peep out
of the darn thing.  Sound under Linux worked a treat, first
time.  Those people who are curious, it's an FV24 VIA
motherboard with on-board sound.
<p>
The machine is currently sitting in the lounge-room, and has
a TV connection, but no connection to the sound system yet.
 Considering the purchase of a Creative Extigy and a bunch
of high quality surround speakers, but I'm sure that would
be excessive at this stage.

Again, many many thanks to Ian for providing his wealth of
knowledge regarding hardware and drivers.
