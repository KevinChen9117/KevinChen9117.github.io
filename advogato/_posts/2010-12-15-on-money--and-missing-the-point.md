There are oftentimes when I talk enthusiastically about sharing my skills,
techniques, and knowledge with other people. Usually this is greeted with
enthusiasm in return, but sometimes I get a strange reaction... Whether it's
improving one's codebase, or creating a spectacular outfit, or simply getting
interesting people to meet and share their ideas, I'll occasionally have a
friend ask me if I *really* want to be doing that, because I'm giving away
my "secrets".

I appreciate that in business, a competitive advantage is a good thing. Being
able to differentiate yourself from your competition is vitally important, and
sharing one's secrets with those who might use them to compete with you isn't
always a wise choice.

My problem with this attitude is that it assumes that *money* is the point
of the exercise.  It's easy to think this, and from a business perspective it
might be true, but thinking of money as the goal kind of misses the whole point
of living.

<!--more-->

Without boring you with technical terms, the whole point of living isn't money,
it's *happiness*.  Money certainly has utility in providing hhappiness,
but it's not the exclusive source.  In fact we've got plenty of studies that
show us that money isn't what makes us happy, it's just that being poor makes
us unhappy.  After a point, the utility of money drops off very sharply indeed.

The idea of me keeping trade secrets is even more amusing because my entire
livelihood for the last decade has been based purely upon working in open
source. Almost everything in [our business](http://perltraining.com.au/)
that we can give away, we do all.  All the tips, course notes, software, ideas,
and everything else invariable gets released under an open source license.  The
business model isn't about keeping fragile secrets which must be guarded, the
business model is about being so obviously and outstandingly awesome that
people will pay for our services.

So when I talk about sharing skills, I most sincerely want people to learn from
that.  I *want* them to be able to do the things I can; in fact, I want
them to do them *better* than me.  I'm not worried about competing with
other people, for the simple fact that I'm not competing. The world is a better
place with more free software developers, more public speakers, more artists,
more fancy costumes, more collectives of clever people, and more *fun*.

Knowledge transfer is one of my most treasured and beloved activities.  To
everyone's who's taught me to give a massage, tie a celtic knot, write a
program, sew fabric, administer a system, identify cognitive defects, go
diving, ride a bike, play with contact juggling, make a cocktail, play music on
a leaf, use a camera, talk like a pirate, and all the other skills that slip my
mind right now.  Thank you.  Thank you so very, very much.  You are *way*
more valuable than money.
