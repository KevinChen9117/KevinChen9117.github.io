<p><b>Perl 5.10.1 released</b><br>
I have a commitment to <a href="http://www.enlightenedperl.org/ironman.html">blog about Perl every week</a>, and this week I was really worried about what I'd write.  I've just returned from five weeks of International travel, and my scant time back in Melbourne has been spent <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pfenwick/sets/72157622100698168/">taking photos</a> at <a href="http://www.manifest.org.au/">Manifest</a>, rather than working on anything technical.
<p>
It's good that I haven't done anything newsworthy, because it would be completely over-ridden by the news that <b><a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2009/08/msg150172.html">Perl 5.10.1 has been released</a></b>.  This release has a special place in my heart, as 5.10.1 includes <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?autodie">autodie</a> as a core module, and as most of you know, I'm very fond of autodie.
<p>
I'm in the process of writing a "What's New in Perl 5.10.1" summary, which will appear as a <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/tips/">Perl Tip</a> in the next couple of days.  Subscribe by <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/perl-tips">e-mail</a>, <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/tips/index.atom">Atom</a>, or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Perl-Tips/109712847802">Facebook</a> if you want to see the tip as soon as it goes out.
