<B>Advogato</b><BR>
My first day on Advogato.  After watching
<A HREF=http://www.advogato.org/person/dancer/>Dancer</a>
reveal his innermost secrets into Advogato many times, I
finally visited to see what was going on.  Looks like a very
useful resource, I plan to come back here often.
<P>
There are a few caching issues, though.  I had a great time
trying to log in until I realised I kept getting cached
copies of pages.  Likewise I've been tempted a few times to
type into my cached copy of Dancer's diary editor. :)
<P>
<B>GnuCash/Quote.pm</b><BR>
Last night I grabbed the CVS sources of <A
HREF=http://www.gnucash.org/>GnuCash</a>, looking for a
better way of keeping track of my finances.  In a fit of
hacking I added support for stock quotes from the Australian
Stock Exchange (ASX), and posted patches back to <A
HREF=http://sourceforge.net/patch/?func=detailpatch&patch_id=100174&group_id=192>SourceForge</a>
<P>
Unfortuately, SourceForge ate my patch -- or more correctly,
ate all the backslashses in my patch.  I don't seem to be
the only only afflicted by this problem, a few of the other
patch-files I looked at seemed to have a large number of
strings ending with "...n".  If any readers would like a
copy of the (un-munged) patches, please let me know.
<P>
Contacted the other authors of the Quote.pm module regarding
a release to CPAN.  I would have loved a module like this
about a month ago when I was toying with stock-monitoring
software.

<B>Work</b><BR>
I've had a surprisingly good day at work today.  Nobody's
come to me with bugs, the projects I've been working on have
been ticking along smoothly, and I've had lots of time to
hack uninterrupted.  I've even started taking old jobs out
of the job queue and finishing them(!).  Dancer's threatened
to kill me if I get any happier, and I still can't believe
how the coffee here just keeps getting better.
<P>
Today is Margo's last day, which is sad, although she will
be coming back for a bit next week.  I wish her all the very
best in her new job.  It was great having her around.
