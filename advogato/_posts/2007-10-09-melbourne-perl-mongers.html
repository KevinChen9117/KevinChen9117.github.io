<p><b>Effective Procrastination with <a href="http://hiveminder.com/">HiveMinder</a></b><br />
If you're like most people, you've got dozens of things that need doing.
Work, shopping, chores, programming, hobbies, tax, holidays, bills, and so
on.  You may have tried to keep a to-do list, but found it rapidly grew to
the point of being unmanageable.
<p>
Paul Fenwick will demonstrate the use of the free HiveMinder.com to-do
service to both manage tasks and to procrastinate effectively, allowing you
to focus only on the tasks that really need to be done.  We'll see how to
manage tasks via the web, via-email, and how to be really efficient via
instant messenger.
<p>
To conclude, we'll see how it's possible to add new features to HiveMinder
and some tricks and tips for doing so.
