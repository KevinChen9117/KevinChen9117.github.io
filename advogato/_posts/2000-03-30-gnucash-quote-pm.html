Interviewed a potential employee today for one of our perl
developer spots.  This time I had a whole 15 minutes to
prepare for the interview, although 10 of those minutes were
spent trying to find the resume.  In the end all worked out
well.

Dan is beginning to seriously annoy me with the delays in
the performance reviews.  I'm going to be pine-cone'ing him
very soon if he doesn't up his game.
