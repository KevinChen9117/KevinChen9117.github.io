<B>Petting zoo</b><BR>
We've been discovered by some of the local school-children, and during the school holidays became something of a petting zoo.  Chickens apparently have extra cool value with primary school kids.
<p>
"I'm not going to tell <i>anyone</i> about this place, it's just too cool!" was remarked by one younger of the two children who discovered our property.  Within a week she "hadn't told" another half dozen children or so.
<p>
The girls want to play with power-tools, and paint the house, of course.
<p>
<b>Tax</b><br>
Tax returns suck.  Most people just need to put in their income, how much tax was taken out, write $300 in the box marked "other business expenses", and wait for their cheque.  When you're actually running a business (especially if you start it part-way through the financial year), things become much more difficult.
<p>
What makes it even more fun is that in my haste last year I claimed a bunch of small purchases as regular purchases, not asset purchaes.  I believe due to their low cost and nature this is fine.  However I can depreciate an asset over multiple years, and I'm expecting to have a significantly higher income over this year (and the years to come) compared to last year, so depreciating assets are good, so I don't want these as expenses anymore.  That stick of RAM is an asset now (or an improvement to an asset).
<p>
What this means in the end is a bunch of paperwork.  Hoorah.  I love paperwork for the tax department.
<p>
<b>Support</b><BR>
Acting in a support role for a business who has their technical manager travelling around Europe for a month.  I get to answer both questions from the business and their clients.  So far this support has involved pointing out the space at the end of a filename, and listening to "but the note here says that if this happens I should do blah, but if I *do* blah, then....  Oh, it works.  Thanks Paul!"
<p>
<b>X-COM</b><BR>
Never played the original before, only X-COM 3.  Original X-COM rocks.
<p>
<b>Big filesystems</b><br>
Yup, it does takes <i>ages</i> to fsck 240Gb of drives.  Never again.  Ext3 is now in the server's kernel.

<b><a href="http://www.linuxchix.org/">LinuxChix</a></b><br>
Rocked up to a Melbourne get-together of LinuxChix.  I'm not on any of the mailing lists, but everyone seemed happy enough to have me there as the token male.  Lots of fun was had by all, and I was surprised that one person remembered me from rec.food.veg many many many years ago.  I'm looking forward to the next meeting.
