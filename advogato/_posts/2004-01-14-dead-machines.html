<B>Dead machines</b><BR>
Two dead machines in two days.  The first killed by a bad PCI card, the second killed by its power supply dying a horrible death.

We're not particularly concerned about either.  Sure, they need to be resurrected, but either were critical, and any important data they had was on the main fileserver.

New laptop is fun.
