<B>UPS</b><BR>
After a bit of fiddling, the UPS finally works the way it
should.  Trial-and-error revealed what the functions were
for the various pins on the cable provided with the unit,
and <i>genpower</i> did the rest.  Teddybear (our server)
will now happily shut itself down on power failure and
switch itself (and the switch and the ADSL modem) off.  When
power is restored, everything comes back nicely.  No fscks
involved.
<p>
Anyone who purchases an UpSonic Power Guardian should know
that the attached cable can be treated as an "apc1-nt" by
genpower.  No doubt the Linux software that comes with the
unit also works.
