<B>Weekend</b><BR>
What a great weekend.  Beautiful weather, warm sunlight and
blue skies, which is unusual for winter.  Spent a lot of
time in the garden, used much compost, mulched many things,
admired our earthworms, and planted more than a dozen
sunroots.  Made a yummy dandelion ommelette for breakfast,
and the excess sunroot and silverbeet that was growing made
quite a nice curry.  I'm looking forward to spring and the
growing things that come with it.
