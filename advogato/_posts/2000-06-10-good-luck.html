<B>Good luck</b><BR>
I wish <A

all the best in giving up smoking.  Hang in there.
<P>
<B>House-hunting</b><BR>
Like <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/aaronl>aaronl</a>, I
also went looking at houses today.  Unlike aaronl, I was
looking at small 2 bedroom places, rather than ones with 16
fireplaces and a T1.
<P>
I didn't expect to be looking at houses at this time of
year, but this one in particular happened to catch my eye. 
It's in Preston (not <I>too</i> far from the city), has lots
of land, and is quite affordable.  The only problem is that
the house itself is quite small.  It should be fine for
Jacinta and myself to live there, but if Gwen were to move
in as well it would be rather cramped.
<P>
I'm going to arrange for a second inspection and if we still
like it we'll throw them an offer and see what they say.  I
would very dearly like to own my own house, and this place
certainly has enough space for livestock and vegetables to
keep me happy for a while.

<B>Melbourne geeks -- two degrees of separation</b><BR>
It seems that every geek I meet in Melbourne is related to
every other geek by at most one other person.  <A
HREF=http://www.glasswings.com.au/attendants.html>Katherine</a>
had her birthday party last night, and I met a girl there
named Nicole.  She ended up knowing me from when I worked at
the University of Melbourne, and I ended up knowing her
partner from when I was a student.
