<p><b>autodie release 1.10_06 - Codename chocolateboy</b><br>
I'm very pleased to say that the next release of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?autodie">autodie</a> is making its way to CPAN.  The release's codename is "chocolateboy", after the wonderful author of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?autobox">autobox</a> who spent many hours discussing the inner workings of pragmas, provided thousands of words of advice, and who allowed me to use him as a sounding-board when I had far too many ideas and not enough implementation.
<p>
The new version provides massive improvements in Perl 5.8 support, including:

<ul>
<li>User subroutines can be lexicalised
<li>Fatal and autodie can be used together
<li>Fatal backwards compatibility mode fixed
<li>autodie will no longer cause weird interactions with autobox
<li>Better error messages
<li>Lower memory overheads
<li>Faster loading
</ul>
<p>
I've still got a huge list of things left to do, but this release is a major stepping stone since it contains code that can lexicalise arbitrary subroutines, with many thanks to <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=693338">ikegami for help in debugging</a>.
<p>
My next big tasks are:
<ul>
<li>Moving the Perl 5.10 implementation to use the Perl 5.8 code, which is actually faster and has less side-effects.
<li>Writing a whole stack of documentation on how to use it, why you'd want to, and what bugs exist.
<li>Having a really good think about the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?autodie::exception">autodie::exception</a> interface.  I'm planning to bounce ideas off the <a href="http://moose.perl.org/">Moose</a> crowd for this one.
</ul>
