<B>Warboid World</b><BR>
Just got a letter from Peter giving me his blessings to
resurrect Warboid World under an open source license.  It
looks like the license for the server-engine may end up
being QPL.  I expect the clients for playing the game will
be under whatever license their authors choose.
<P>
No, QPL isn't my favourite license, but it does serve the
important purpose of allowing the original author(s) the
ability to spin-off closed-source variants.  There's also
nothing to say we can't do a TrollTech later on and go from
QPL to QPL/GPL.
<P>
<B>Tim's Party</b><BR>
Tim from work had his 21st yesterday, and made an open
invition to all the office if people wanted to come.  Most
fun I've had in a group for a long time, the night really
kicked off well.
<P>
We went to a place called the "Glow Bar", which had the most
(or possibly second-most) amazing toilets I had seen --
pretty much everything (the washbasins, the hand-dryer, the
urinal) was a mirror, which certainly made bathroom ettique
interesting.  It's a shame that <a href="/person/rcp/">rcp</a> wasn't
there, I'm sure he would have loved it.
<P>
I left that a somewhat reasonable time, aware of me having
to work the next day.  Kat came to work with a hangover, and
Dan didn't arrive at all.  All up, a fantastic night was had
by all.
<P>
<B>Growing things</b><BR>
Wow, I knew that radishes grew quickly, but I'm still very
impressed by my collection of them.  It's been about a month
and they're already of a quite edible size.
<P>
<B>Melbourne Cup</b><BR>
To some people, it's a horse race.  For myself and many
others, it's a day off work.  Spent the day cycling around
Melbourne -- Merri Creek to Darebin Creek (REALLY pretty in
spots) and then to the Yarra River.  Collected a bunch of
wild garlic that the recent rains had washed up, and got to
meditate on a rock in the middle of the Darebin creek. 
Wonderful day, I'm still feeling good about it.
<P>
