<b>Ariel Miyu Golembo born, 2pm, 6th July 2005</b><br/>
I'm very pleased to have received a phonecall from Daniel and Tomoko to
say that Ariel Miyu Golembo was born without any complications at 2pm
today.  Ariel is 40cm long, weighs in at 2.4kg, and is apparently very
loud when she's awake.  Tomoko and Ariel will be returning home in four
days time.
<p>
Congratulations Tomoko and Daniel!
