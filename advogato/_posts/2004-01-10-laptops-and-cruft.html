<B>Laptops and cruft</b><BR>
Got a new laptop.  It's very nice.  Big screen, high resolution, fast CPU, wireless networking.  All those good things.
<p>
Installing Linux on it is a pain. I expected it would be, and so far things have gone just about as well as expected, which is very slowly and painfully.
<p>
In the process of setting things up, I got out my old WL200 wireless network card, since I actually have a motivation to use it now.  Unfortunately, it was one of the pieces of hardware that the floods a few weeks back managed to affect.  I thought it was okay, but apparently not.  It's taken out a desktop machine.  Either a dead powersupply, or dead motherboard.  Hopefully a dead powersupply.
<p>
I'm not eager to try the card in another machine now.  I'm a bad sad that it's dead, since it's possible to convert the card into an access point, and it's got good support under linux.  And it cost quite a bit of money.  Drat.
<p>
I can see at least one other network in my area, apparently if I walk down the street I can see Ian's as well.
<p>
I may well end up buying an 802.11 to ethernet access-point/bridge.  Probably less stuffing around.  Even so, the WL200 would have gone into our loungeroom PC.  Hardware sucks, and it sucks more when it dies and takes things with it.
