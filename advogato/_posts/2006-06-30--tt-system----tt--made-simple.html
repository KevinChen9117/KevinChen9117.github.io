<p><b><tt>system()</tt> made simple</b><br />
In preparation for an upcoming tutorial I'm presenting on using Perl for system administration, I'm looking at ways to make <tt>system()</tt> more simple to use.  Presently most developers have to go to quite a bit of work to check any command ran with <tt>system</tt> was successful, or worse yet they don't check at all.
<p>
The discussions regarding this matter can be found on <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.modules/;msgid=200606280258.k5S2wGHI026750[at]pause.perl.org">the modules list</a>, and on <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=557107">PerlMonks</a>.
I'm presently seeking as much feedback as possible, on the API, on names, and on ideas.
<p>
My overall goal is to make the <i>easiest</i> choice also the <i>most correct</i> choice for the vast majority of cases.  That means easy not only easy to write, but also easy for a developer to learn and comprehend.
<p>
<tt>brian d foy</tt> has already <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.modules/49625">provided feedback</a> on possible names via the modules list.  As much as it made me laugh, <tt>IPC::JFDI</tt> is probably going to be non-obvious to much of my target audience.  ;)
<p>
Feedback via the <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=557107">PerlMonks node</a> is preferable.

<b>Web Standards Group</b><br />
Melbourne has a Web Standards Group, and they have cool people, and free food!  Best of all, last night they even <a href="http://webstandardsgroup.org/meetings/index.cfm?event_id=67">let me present to them</a>, and laughed at my jokes.  I'm really amazed that I've been ignorant of their existence for so long.
