<B>House</b><BR>
Vendor isn't selling. At least we have a straight answer
now.  Guess I'll have to wait until Ian and Sofie find me
another house.  :)

<B>Blooper of the Week</b><BR>
It would appear that our phone system depends upon our DNS
functioning correctly.  Broken DNS = Broken phones.  Utterly
weird.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Volker Stuerzl has been kind enough to write and contribute
a Deutsche Bank Gruppe module for Finance::Quote.  We can
expect it to be released with version 1.02.
<P>
Unfortunately the ASX have re-butchered their site, and so
the ASX module is broken.  This sucks because the 1.01 test
suite takes FOREVER to run, because it results in timeouts
rather than unreachable host/refused connection.  Guess I'll
have to rewrite the ASX module properly so that it batches
requests.
<P>
I intend to roll F::Q 1.01 into GnuCash this weekend. 
Promise.
