<p><b>Malaysia, London, Lisbon, oh my!</b><br>
If I seem slow to respond, distracted, or exhausted, here's
why...
<p>

Yes, that's a whole month of solid travel, averaging only
about 2.3 days in any one place at a time.  If you wish to
track my trips (eg, to see if I happen to arrive in your
part of the world), or if you're curious, you can do so via

Right now I'm in Lisbon.  I'm exhausted, and have talks to
prepare for YAPC::EU.  However I suspect a bath and a snooze
is going to trump talk preparation for once.
