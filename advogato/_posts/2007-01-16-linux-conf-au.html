<p><b>linux.conf.au</b><br />
The second day of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jdubflickr/346169230/">linux.con f.au</a> draws to a close.  The second day of mini-confs, I was able to learn a little more about <a href="http://www.wesnoth.org/">Battle for Wesnoth</a> and attend interesting discussions on networking and negotiation.
<p>
My biggest regret is that I wasn't able to attend much of the <a href="http://linuxchix.org/">LinuxChix</a> miniconf as I would have liked.  I'd like to say that my biggest achievement is reworking the slides for my talk on Thursday, but I'm still doing that.
<p>
Last night we had the Speakers' Dinner, which was held on a boat that cruised around Sydney Harbour.    This event was the single point of failure for the conference, if the boat sunk, so would the conference.  Luckily the cruise went without a hitch, and provided plenty of opportunity for photos of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pfenwick/tags/sydney/">prominent landmarks</a>, but I spent much more time talking to the people on the boat than looking out the window.
<p>
It's interesting to see how different the speaker demographics are for LCA compared to <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">OSDC</a>.  At OSDC I can hardly move without bumping into Perl people.  At LCA they're much more sparse, and I've probably spent more time with the Python crowd.
<p>
At the end of today was the Google party, where drinks, food, and swag were generously donated.  I've taken my leave early, partially due to a full social buffer, partially due to the loud music, and partially due to me still wanting to rewrite my slides.
<p>
Tomorrow is the start of the conference proper, which I'm hoping will come with more generous seating arrangements.  With a conference this big it's hard not to end up on the floor for popular talks.
