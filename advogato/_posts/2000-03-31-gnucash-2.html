<B>GnuCash</b><BR>
Suspected that there may be problems in the flow of messages
between my machine and that of GnuCash's mail server.  In an
attempt to track down the problem, I sent numerous messages
to addresses like bounce-me-please@gnucash.org -- expecting
to see bouncing messages (or a lack thereof) to help me
diagnose faults.
<P>
After a bit of time wondering why things weren't coming
back, I received a letter from Jeremy Collins with one of my
subject lines: '<I>BOUNEC ME NOW GNUCASH!</i>' (sic) with
the text `HA HA! Enjoy!'.
<P>
It seems that all those bogus addresses I was sending to
were actually landing in Jeremy's mailbox.  Ooops!  I've
apologised to Jeremy for spamming him.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Work has been surprisingly quiet today -- or at least it has
for me, anyway.  Maybe the horrendous number of bugs and
emergencies that normally get thrown to me have lulled me
into a false sense of insecurity.
