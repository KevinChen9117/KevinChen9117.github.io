<B>House</b><BR>
Looks like we've finally found a house that the vendor is
willing to sign.  We've had a verbal agreement regarding the
property in East Coburg, and will be signing the contract
tomorrow morning.  I'm currently trying to convince a bank
that application fees are a stupid idea.

<B>Health</b><BR>
Haven't been feeling too good these last few days.  There's
been a nasty that's been floating around work -- starts as a
sore throat, hibernates for a while, and then blossoms from
there.  It's well blossomed with me right now.  As long as I
don't move away from the eucalyptus burner I don't feel too
bad.

Today was <a href="/person/Dancer/">Dancer</a>'s last day at Schnet. 
Dragged myself in to cross-pollinate diseases, wish him
well, and give him a big hug.  I'm going to miss the old
raindeer, especially his beautiful sarcasm. 
<a href="/person/Dancer/">Dancer</a> is actually quite a warm, caring
individual who will be sorely missed.  I wish him all the
very best of luck in the future.
