<B>Neighbours</b><BR>
Met our neighbours today, with whom we share a wall. 
They're extremely cool.  They're geeks (like us), they're
about our age, they're vegan (we're vegetarian), they're
interested in sustainable living, and they know all the same
people we know.  They're very friendly, and have been kind
enough to offer a length of CAT-5 over the fence (or to
drill a hole through the wall) to give us decent network
connectivity until our new line gets put in.
<P>
Gave them some Earth Garden magazines to read and a free
copy of TPJ #19.  We're probably going to go out to dinner
this weekend, and maybe go along the Merri Creek to go
spotting edible plants.  Oh yes, they also like chickens and
ducks.
<P>
The bad news about the neighbours is that they're only
renting, so potentially they may leave at some point to
be replaced with boring neighbours.  I hope this
doesn't happen.
