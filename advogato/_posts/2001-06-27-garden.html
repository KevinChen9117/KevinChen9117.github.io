1.06 was released yesterday, and despite a few hiccups with 
<A HREF="http://pause.perl.org/">PAUSE</a> (the CPAN upload 
tool), and <A HREF="http://www.sf.net/">SourceForge</a>'s 
database, it all went quite smoothly.
<P>
I'm chuffed at how many people are sending me source code 
and feedback.  I've got to look into setting up a better 
infrastructure so that Quotelets (the modules that run with 
F::Q) can be distributed and updated seperately to the main 
release.
<P>
Discovered that F::Q even gets a mention in a <A 
HREF="http://ironbark.bendigo.latrobe.edu.au/subjects/bitwen
/lectures/l21.d/Lect21.html">lecture stream</a> at LaTrobe 
University in Bendigo.  That made me smile.

Water tank (1030 litres) arrived today.  Will be installed 
and operational next week.  Should provide us with a plenty 
big supply of water.
<P>
Divided the rhubarb, and as such have oodles of rhubarb 
that we're trying to use up.  Crown segments have gone into 
our front garden, our neighbours garden, and the place 
where the rhubarb was originally.  Provided that they don't 
all die, I'll be extremely happy.
<P>
<B>Fire Safety</b><BR>
Four new smoke detectors in the house, rather than the one 
dodgy one that came with the place.  Going to have to move 
the one in the hallway as it's blocking one of the 
cupboards doors.  (Only noticed that one AFTER I'd screwed 
the thing to the ceiling.)
