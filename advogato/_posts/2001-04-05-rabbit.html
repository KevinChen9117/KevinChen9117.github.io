<B>Rabbit</b><BR>
We've decided that a good name for our rabbit/lawn-mower is
<I>Shadow</i>, as he actively avoids sunlight.  As a black
rabbit, this makes a lot of sense from a staying
cool/avoiding detection standpoint.
<P>
I'm considering investing in a water-pistol of some sort to
give the local cats a bit of extra encouragement not to
visit.  I've always chased them from the yard as a matter of
course, but now that we have Shadow I need to be
particularly alert.  It's a shame we can't let him roam
unsupervised.

<a href="/person/jenni/">jenni</a> doesn't seem to be updating her diary
at all, so I'll take this moment to do so for her...

<I>Purchased a house the other day, big three bedroom thing
with gold-embossed walls, marble statues, and landscaped
gardens.  It's much better than PJF's house (which I still
haven't seen yet), although I did have to pay a little extra
for it.  Talking of PJF, now that I have a house and am
feeling so rich I'll have to buy him lunch again.</i>
