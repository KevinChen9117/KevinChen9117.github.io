<p><b>Happy New Rootkit</b><br/>
I'm back from holidays, and had intended to write about all the interesting diving I had managed to get done.
<p>
Unfortunately, the machine of one of our clients was compromised this afternoon, so instead I'm currently in the process of cleaning things up.  I know how the attackers got in, and I have clean backups that verify without an issue.  The main thing now is gaining physical access to the machine and the dull dull task of cleaning the disks and initiating a restore.  There's reason to believe that the kernel has been modified by a direct write to /dev/kmem, so <i>nothing</i> the machine tells me can possibly be trusted.
<p>
This particular compromise falls into the "What?  I didn't know we had that installed (outside of the packaging system)" category.
