<B>Hacky Injury</b><BR>
An important lesson for all those people planning to play
hackey-sack in an office environment.  If you're playing
without shoes, and the hackey comes down just on the corner
of a table, pull your kick.  Table-corners hurt a lot when
you kick them with the upper bits of your feet.

<B>Rockclimbing</b><BR>
Had a great time rockclimbing.  Kathryn came with us this
week, and showed an excellent amount of skill for a
first-time climber.  I climbed the black that I'd been
working on for a couple of weeks, and decided that it's
either been made a lot easier, or I've become a much better
climber.  At the end of the day we had races up the red
climb on the training wall, and I lost.  I blame it on my
colour-blindness, having to always look twice before going
for a hold.

After visiting the real-estate agent we decided to put our
offer in on Saturday when we'd be eligible for the $7000
government bonus for first home-buyers.
