<p><b>Cross-browser compatibility</b><br/>
We've got a <a href="http://new.perltraining.com.au/">redesign of the Perl Training Australia</a> website that's in its final stages of testing.  Everything seems to be working great until I started compatibility testing.
<p>
The site works wonderfully in Mozilla browsers, and reportedly in Safari.  It works well in Internet Explorer (MSIE) 6 and 5.5, but without some of the CSS features that MSIE doesn't support.  It looks awesome in lynx and w3m (text-based browsers), and degrades nicely in Netscape 4.7x.
<p>
The site is horribly, horribly wrong in MSIE 5.0 and 4.01, both of which completely muck up the menus.  How long are we going to keep supporting these old, standards-challenged browsers?
<p>
Currently investigating fixes, and checking to see how many of our visitors actually use MSIE 4.0/5.0.
<p>
Anyone who wishes to check out <a href="http://new.perltraining.com.au/">the new site</a> and provide feedback is most welcome to do so.  Either comment on my <a href="http://use.perl.org/~pjf/journal/">use.perl</a> journal, or <a href="mailto:pjf@perltraining.com.au">drop me an e-mail</a>.
