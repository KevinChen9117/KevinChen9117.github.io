<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Awright!  Finance::Quote now does automatic currency
conversion, and makes it dead-simple to use:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>
use Finance::Quote;<BR>
my $quoter = Finance::Quote-&gt;new;<BR>
$quoter-&gt;set_currency("AUD");<BR>
my %info = $quoter-&gt;fetch("nasdaq","LNUX");<BR>
</tt>
</blockquote>
<P>
<TT>%info</tt> will now contain information about <I>VA
Linux Systems</i>, except all information will be in
Australian dollars, rather than the US dollars which
<I>Yahoo</i>
supplies it in.  This makes me very happy indeed, and means
that it's now very very very easy to write stock tickers and
the like which show information in your local currency.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
We have very sweet people at work, especially Tim from the
Support team.  Tim hasn't thrown any bugs my way in weeks,
for which I'm very grateful.
