<p><b>Nigel McFarlane, RIP</b><br/>
I was shocked to read <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=24171">this article</a>.  Nigel McFarlane was an active and vibrant member of the Australian open source community.  Our first real encounter with Nigel was when he called wanting to interview Jacinta for a newspaper feature-article on Melbourne's successful open source businesses.  The interview resulted in a discussion of <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a> in one of Australia's most widely-read newspapers.  After that it seemed that I was bumping into Nigel everywhere &mdash; industry functions, user groups, conferences, and an almost endless number of mailing lists.
<p>
Nigel was an author of numerous books, a strong supporter and active member of the Mozilla/Firefox project, a regular speaker at conferences, and even drew crowds for 2600 meetings.
<p>
Nigel's insight, talent, and enthusiasm will be sorely missed.
