<B>New machine</b><BR>
Have the tower case, hard-drives and RAM.  Mobo and CPU are to be delivered shortly.  All the other bits are coming out of our current server (a P133 machine).  Starting off with 160Gb in RAID-5 (3x 80Gb drives), I figure that if I need more space it will be much cheaper adding more drives later, rather than going a full 240Gb worth of RAID now.

Very happy that woody is stable now, since potato really was starting to show its age.

Upgrade will probably happen late this week when all the remaining bits arrive.  Hate having to actually touch the hardware and deal with messy heatsink compounds and cut my thumb on sharp edge cases and all the rest of it.  I'll be glad when it's finished, though.

Really wanting to move the office to its new location, which involves getting some recabling done by a person in posession of an Austel license.  Awfully convenient that my future father-in-law has one of them.
