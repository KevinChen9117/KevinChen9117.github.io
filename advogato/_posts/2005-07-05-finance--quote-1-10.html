<p><b>Finance::Quote 1.10</b><br/>
After almost two years in the making, Finance::Quote 1.10 has finally been released, and is now available from a CPAN near you.  All fame and praise should go to David Hampton, who's been leading the effort since I ran out of tuits. David has been doing a fantastic job of fixing, integrating, co-ordinating, and just making things work.  Grand kudos to David.

The new code includes a number of contributions from the community.  Since the last relesae, quotelets have been added for:

<ul>
	<li>Athens Stock Exchange
	<li>BMO NesbittBurns
	<li>Finance Canada
	<li>First Trust Portfolios
	<li>AMFI India
	<li>Man Investments Australia
	<li>New Zealand Stock Exchange
	<li>Platinum Asset Management
	<li>Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB)
	<li>TD Waterhouse Efunds
	<li>US Govt. Thrift Savings Plan
	<li>Yahoo Brasil
	<li>Yahoo New Zealand
</ul>
<p>
A huge thanks also goes out to the great many contributors of code and bugfixes.  Finance::Quote would be a very dull and buggy module without you.
