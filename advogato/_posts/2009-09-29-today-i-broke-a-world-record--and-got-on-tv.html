<p><b>Perl for Android</b>
<p>
I have an Android phone.  I love it.  After <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/">scanning
a barcode</a> it now runs Perl.  Sure, the example Hello
World program dies with an error, but there's <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/issues/detail?id=97">already
a patch to fix that</a>.
<p>
This is a massively exciting achievement for me, and is even
better for it having all of ninety seconds.  It's now
tantalisingly easy to do some pretty amazing things from my
phone.  I don't think I'm going to be short for a project
any time
soon.
