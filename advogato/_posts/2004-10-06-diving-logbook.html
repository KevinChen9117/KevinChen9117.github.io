<b>Diving Logbook</b><br/>
I've slowly started to convert my diving logbook from paper form to <a href="http://pjf.id.au/dive/">digital form</a>.  I've still got a number of dives to enter, as well as photographs to add, and that will no doubt happen as time permits.
<p>
Of note of the dives that I have entered was our <a href="http://pjf.id.au/dive/07.html">"deep dive"</a>.  It describes a rather interesting of inexperienced divers, strong currents, and our first dive below 18 metres.
