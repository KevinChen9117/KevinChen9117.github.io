        <b>OSDC, Day 1</b><br/>
        Went to bed at about 1:30am last night.  Woke at 6am today.
        Waking at 6am tomorrow.  Exhausted, exhausted, exhausted.
        <p>
        Putting some photos <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=340&count=1">on-line</a> because I took so many.  Most didn't
        work out, the camera is very poor for indoor conditions.  The
        good camera which we were supposed to get before the conference
        didn't reach us, and probably won't until next week.  It's free,
        so there's not much we can do there.
        <p>
        Going to bed.  Must sleep.
