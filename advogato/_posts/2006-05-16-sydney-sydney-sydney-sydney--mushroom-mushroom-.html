<p><b>Sydney Sydney Sydney Sydney, Mushroom Mushroom!</b><br />
Of the last two weeks, one and half was spent in Sydney teaching.  I was elected (as the sole applicant) to <a href="http://melbourne.pm.org/">Melbourne.pm</a> secretary, even though I was interstate during the AGM.  I had a great time catching up with the members of <a href="http://sydney.pm.org/">Sydney.pm</a>, who all seemed more than willing to keep buying me drinks at the local pub.  A good time was had by all, with door-prizes for everyone, including wooden planes, regexp coffee mugs, and books.
<p>
Saturday was spent with friends who recently got an  <a href="http://www.eyetoy.com/">Eye Toy</a>, a small camera that takes the place of a game regular controller, allowing the user to interact visually with the console.  Much time was spent playing air-guitar, dodging balls, and showboating balance skills.  Overall a great gadget, although one that <i>needs</i> a lots of space and lighting for correct operation.
<p>
Sunday was spent mushrooming, hunting for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanterelle">Chanterelles</a>.  While our regular mushrooming ground wasn't available this year, we found a number of excellent patches nearby.  The evening was spent cleaning mushrooms, freezing mushrooms, pickling mushrooms, eating mushroom soup with fried mushrooms, and playing Space Hulk.
<p>
The week ahead is going to be spent playing catch-up before I travel again for another interstate trip.  Luckily I'll be prepared for this trip with a box of miniature paints and a copy of <a href="http://thesims2.ea.com/">The Sims 2</a>, which I'm using to help me research an upcoming <a href="http://conf.sage-au.org.au/speakers.html#fenwick_paper">conference paper</a>.  Honest!
