<B>Wireless keyboard/mouse</b><BR>
New wireless keyboard and mouse (made by A4 tech) arrived
today, and they work beautifully.  I can type from another
room and all works fine.  Considering the purchae of another
set for the second machine, since they're just so darn handy
and nice to use.
<p>
Apparently each keyboard and mouse has its own serial ID,
which the receiver can remember (and hence excluse all
others).  In theory this lets you run lots of wireless
keyboards/mice side-by-side, and while syncing your keyboard
to your receiver is an easy button-press, I can't quite
figure out how the mouse is done without software.  Even so,
the units have two channels they can operate on, so a second
keyboard/mouse combo should not be a huge problem.

<b>Mackay</b><BR>
Spent some time in sunny Queensland (Mackay area).  Took me
a day to get used to the heat and humidity, but very much
enjoyed myself after that.  Went ocean rafting, which was a
lot of fun, but I pretty much had to be dragged out of the
water at snorkling time.  Coral reefs are really pretty, and
all the stories you've heard about swimming with schools of
fish are true.
<p>
Also found the most perfect property imaginable up there. 
Hundreds of fruit trees, green pastures, house in perfect
ocndition, permanent creek, and an amazing swimming hole. 
Reasonably priced, too.  Trouble is, we're not really
looking at moving yet, and in order to purchase and move
we'd need to do a lot of employment, financial, and social
juggling.  I also doubt I can get a high-speed, low-latency
Internet connection in the middle of nowhere.  :)
<p>
<b>Work</b><br>
Lots of work to do.  Never rains it pours sort of thing. 
That's good, because it looks like I've got a secure line of
jobs lined up for the next 3-4 months.  No starving here.
<p>
<b>Investment</b><br>
Having looked at the farm in Mackay sparked a big session of
financial planning.  Found some great investment properties
in Mackay (excellent rental returns), but Mackay's property
prices aren't exactly moving, and the average price of units
fell a little over the last year.  Mackay's a small place,
so any statistics on prices there should be taken with a
large grain of salt.
<p>
Looking at properties closer to Melbourne, somewhat because
it's easier to get to (living in Melbourne at all), and
somewhat because of the high population and property value
growth.
