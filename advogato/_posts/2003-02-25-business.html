<B>Business</b><BR>
Working as a consultant for an old employer.  Lots of happy people there who are glad to have me around.  However, this means that I'm out of the office for 70% of business hours, which doesn't leave me with much time to run <i>my</i> business and attend to my less demanding customers.
<P>
Jacinta should be starting her first week of proper part-time work with <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a> this week, so hopefully she'll be able to keep things in check until they quieten down (about a month's time).
<p>
<b>Health</b><br>
Jacinta's all healed, out of the neckbrace, and fit enough to go diving.  This is a very good thing.
<p>
<b>Diving</b><br>
Some very generous friends of ours gave us a free "dive experience" voucher which they had won, since they already had dive licenses and didn't need supervisors to hold their hands underwater.  The "experience" was a lot of theory, hand-signals, and exercises, and less actual diving than I would have preferred.
<p>
Met up with an old friend from high-school on the day, who was helping out as an employee of the dive shop.  Apparently it's a fun way to earn extra money to do diving, although I suspect that he's still working as a laywer when not in a wetsuit.
<p>
<b>Tax</b><br>
Q3 BAS done.  I'm glad they only come around four times a year.
<p>
<b>Chickens</b><br>
The chooks are all more-or-less broken.  One's broody, one's laying soft-shelled eggs, one seems to have an egg-eating problem, and the others aren't laying as much as they used to.  It may be time to get new chickens.
<p>
<b>Rabbit</b><br>
Doesn't lay eggs, but hasn't destroyed any electrical equipment recently.  Good rabbit.
<p>
<b>Rain</b><br>
We actually got a decent amount of rain in the last few days.  Enough to fill most of the water tank, and turn our backyard from brown to green.  I'd still like more rain, some of our trees are still rather stressed.
<p>
<b>Phone</b><br>
Have a new mobile phone.  It's free (Jacinta's mother works for a telco), but obviously aimed at teenagers.  It comes with colour screen, polyphonic speaker, and skateboarder animations.  All the ring-tones sound like a slots machine going off.  It's notably missing an infra-red port, so it doesn't talk to the palm pilot at all.
<p>
The nice thing about the phone is that it has a vibrate function.  That's a good thing, considering how embarrassing the ringtones are.
