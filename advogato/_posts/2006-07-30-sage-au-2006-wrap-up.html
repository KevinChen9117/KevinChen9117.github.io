<p><b>SAGE-AU 2006 wrap-up</b><br />
I'm home from <i>The Australian System Administrators Conference</i>, more commonly known as <a href="http://www.sage-au.org.au/conf/sage-au2006/">SAGE-AU 2006</a>.  This year the conference was held in Canberra, in the middle of winter, but since my entire time was spent indoors I didn't really have a chance to discover if the weather was as cold as it was supposed to be.
<p>
<a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a> often uses conferences as a way to boot-strap new courses, and this year the boot-strapped course was Perl for System Administration.  The full-day tutorial was held on Monday, and I stayed up rather late the night before getting the slides and materials just right.
<p>
During the tutorial I discovered that my audience had a lot more knowledge than I had anticipated, but this ended up being very good as I could cover more advanced topics in more depth, and more material overall.  I was also worried that the content wasn't SysAdmin-focused enough, but the great many comments I received after the course indicated otherwise.
<p>
The conference dinner this year was held in the ANZAC museum, which featured a great many original and recreated artifacts from WWII.  Overall it was a very sobering experience, despite the copious amounts of free alcoholic beverages that were available.
<p>
Lee Monette, SAGE-AU's administrative head and heart is moving on to greener pastures, and was given a standing ovation at the dinner for her amazing service to the guild throughout the years.  Lee's efficiency and organisation has been nothing less of astounding, and I am certain she'll have great success in her new adventures.
<p>
Friday morning at 9am I presented my paper on <i>Human Interfaces for Geeks</i>.  I try to put a little humour into my talks, although I wasn't sure how many laughs I'd get with everyone being hung-over from the dinner the night before.
<p>
I was very pleased to discover that SysAdmins keep their sense of humour even after a long night of festivities, and that many had woken "early" and consumed a great deal of caffeine to see my presentation.  The talk was extremely well received, with a great many laughs all around.  With luck, a few people may have even learnt a thing or two.
<p>
I'm now back in Melbourne, enjoying a beautiful weekend before starting on yet another hard-slog finishing our <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/courses/webdev.html">web development</a> course.  My plans are then to stop biting off huge chunks of coursework, and instead take the rest of the decade off.
