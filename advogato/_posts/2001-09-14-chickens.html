<B>Chickens</b><BR>
The coop is finished.  It looks fantastic, and contains all
sorts of things a chook coop needs like nesting boxes,
doors, walls, and even a roof.  The pen goes up today (real
easy, just string up some chook wire), and most of our flock
will arrive tomorrow.
<P>
We're also adopting Brenda's (from my old workplace)
chicken, a beautiful silkie hen.  With any luck she'll be
arriving tonight, so she has an extra chance to get used to
her new surroundings.  I'm very excited.
<P>
Shadow (our rabbit) helped a lot in making the coop,
including the digging of the stump holes, and inspecting our
materials and tools.  We discovered that he hates small
step-ladders (triple-stomp in badness), but he LOVES tall
step-ladders (making a point of sitting under them to eat
grass).  Go figure.
