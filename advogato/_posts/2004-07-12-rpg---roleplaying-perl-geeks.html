<b>RPG - Roleplaying Perl Geeks</b><br>
It's with some delight that I notice how many Perlish people have a few tidbits of roleplaying information on their websites.  Abigail has a <a href="http://www.abigail.nl/MERP/">MERP campaign</a>, and Dan has a <a href="http://www.sidhe.org/whatis.html">what is sidhe.org page</a> stating the website originally existed to provide RPG resources, particularly for <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/">GURPS</a>.

<p> <p>
Most Perl hackers are a busy bunch, and I imagine don't have much time for RPGs.  I don't either, but the players in my game tend to be lawyers, bankers, and software engineers.  As such I'm blessed that I can <a href="http://toee.perltraining.com.au/pub/">point them to a wiki</a> and they'll do an incredible job of maintaining and expanding it.

Recently a few jokes got out of hand, and thus <a href="http://toee.perltraining.com.au/game/">Grugg's Bag o' Meat Action Adventure</a> was born.  All the fun and excitement of 1st Ed AD&amp;D, but with none of the time commitments.
