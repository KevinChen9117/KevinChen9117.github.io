<B>Weddings!</b><BR>
Oh wow!  My friends are all getting engaged.  Congratulations to Ian and Sofie who got engaged last weekend!  There's even more exciting news that I'm not allowed to say, so I won't say that here.
<p>
<B>Chickens</b><BR>
The chook that was having problems with her vent appears to be much better after her adjustment, and has made a full recovery.
<p>
Alas, the chicken that lays broken eggs is still laying broken eggs.

<B>Perl Courses</b><BR>
Our <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/bookings.html">public courses</a> are filling up.  Hurrah.
