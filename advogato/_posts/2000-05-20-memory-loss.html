<B>Memory Loss</b><BR>
After a long time in trying to remember, I've realised that
I can no longer remember my passphrase for my old PGP key
(0x3D33ADCB).  This is bad.  From this lesson I've learnt
that it really is a good idea to have a pre-generated
certificate of revocation for just this circumstance.
<P>
As it is, I've had to contact everyone who's previously
signed the key and ask them to revoke their signature.  I'm
feeling pretty silly at the moment.
<P>
Not many people used my old key, which is good.  And AFAIK,
none of the e-mail addresses on that key still forward. 
This is probably good.
<P>
For those who care, 0xB1479E55 can be used to communicate
with me from now on.
