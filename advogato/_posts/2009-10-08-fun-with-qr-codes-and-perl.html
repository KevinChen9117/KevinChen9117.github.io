<p><b>Fun with QR Codes and Perl</b><br>
Short blog today, but cool tech.  I've been playing around with 2D barcodes recently, and have just pushed a <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/tips/">Perl Tip</a> on <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/tips/2009-10-08.html">generating QR Codes with Perl</a>.  Given how incredibly easy this is, I'm tempted to generate huge numbers of these and go sticking them around town for my own nefarious purposes. ;)
