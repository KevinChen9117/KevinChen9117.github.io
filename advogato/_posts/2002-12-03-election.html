<i>Client:</i> ...and we had to disconnect and move all the equipment because of flash flooding last week.  Since that time we haven't been able to print.

<p>
<i>Me:</i> Oh good, because I'm only going to charge you the bargin price of $750,000.
<p>
<i>Client:</i> Um...  Can we do that in installments?
