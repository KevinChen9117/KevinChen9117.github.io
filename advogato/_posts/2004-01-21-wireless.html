<B>Wireless</b><BR>
I'm writing this from the lawn of a client during my lunchbreak.  They're a University in Melbourne, and have a number of 802.11b antennas mounted around the campus.  The main trick is figuring out where they are.

Unfortunately, my lunch break is over, so this entry is very short.
