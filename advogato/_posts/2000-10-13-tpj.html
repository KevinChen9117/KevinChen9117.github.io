<B>TPJ</b><BR>
It appears that <a href="/person/mojotoad/">mojotoad</a> has also written
an article for the same issue.  Very much looking forward to
reading this.

<B>House</b><BR>
Really getting sick of all the stuff going on beforehand.  I
suspect the first home insurance company who asks me to sign
something will get my home insurance for the first year. 
There should be a loan contract for me to sign on Monday
(provided that all goes well), and we're doing a final
inspection this weekend to make sure that everything is
still there.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Acting very much as a catalyst right now -- helping lots of
other people work efficiently but not getting as much done
myself as I would like.  This is not unusual for me, I seem
to have had a hand in just about everything and so I'm a
good generic person to go to when questions arise.
<P>
Apparently I'm working on a 9-day fortnight, but I'm still
waiting to see this in writing.  I'm still taking the days
off.  There's been a bit of poor communication (some of it
certainly mine) about the changes to my role, and I'll be
much happier once these get cleared up.
<P>
<B>Open-Source</b><BR>
Ha!  Surely I jest.  Unfortunately been too busy to go near
any sort of open-source development, and when I haven't been
too busy all I've wanted to do is anything but programming.

Glad to see that <a href="/person/Dancer/">Dancer</a> is surviving the
USA without too many problems.  I'm missing D's irony and
sarcasm, though.
