<p><b>Fixed Laptop</b><br />
After a week of trying to find a replacement video card for my laptop, I decided that I'd have to bite the bullet and purchase a replacement card from Dell, even if that meant a 2-3 week waiting period.  In the meantime I'd have to beg or borrow laptop resources.
<p>
Luckily for me, when I called Dell Spare Parts I was informed that they had a single card sitting in their distribution centre.  I affirmed that I definitely wanted the card, and then went about ingratiating myself with the service representative and <i>two</i> levels of management.
<p>
The end result was quite impressive.  The card reached me in less than 24 hours, which I didn't think was possible given that it had to travel from Singapore to Melbourne and get cleared by customs along the way.  I now have a working laptop with better graphics performance.  Huzzah!
<p>
The invoice, on the other hand, will take at least a week to arrive.

Despite the expense and inconvenience of repairing the laptop, it has given me a couple of good stories for my <a href="http://conf.sage-au.org.au/speakers.html#fenwick_paper">upcoming SAGE-AU</a> presentation.
