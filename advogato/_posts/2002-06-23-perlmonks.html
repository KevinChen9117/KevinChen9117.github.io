<p> <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=125487">Jacinta</a> has beaten <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=116014">me</a> to the rank of Abbot.  Well done.  :)  It's amazing how much faster writing <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=176224">interesting nodes</a> will gain you experience compared to general lurking and occasional experiences on the chatterbox.

<b>Winter</b><br>
Hoorah, the winter solstace as passed.  I'm looking forward to fruit and warm days and more eggs.  Interestingly enough, even though it's the middle of winter I can still see bees busily working outside my office window, with honey-eaters fluttering around as well.  I'm glad that some trees (in this case a wattle) decide to flower in the middle of winter.
