<b>Bloody Banks</b><br/>
Despite having closed my account a month ago with my old bank, I still haven't received a refund on the amount owing to me, and today I discovered the bank is trying to alter the amount of the refund as well.  They failed to inform me of this, and still can't tell me when I can expect the money.

An official complaint has been lodged and will be escalated to the <a href="http://www.abio.org.au/">Banking Ombudsman</a> if it cannot be resolved.  The Ombudsman not only has some superb powers, but also the <i>requirement</i> to report systemic issues and serious misconduct to <a href="http:/www.asic.gov.au">ASIC</a>.

Banks hate having matters escalated to the Ombudsman.  ;)
