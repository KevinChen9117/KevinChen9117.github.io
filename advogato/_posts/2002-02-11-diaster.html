<B>Diaster</b><BR>
The chickens got into the tomato patch and flattened our
romana tomato plant and some of the chillis.  Our only
consolation is that they probably got a good number of slugs
and snails that were hanging around in there.
<p>
Shadow (our rabbit) seems to be getting more and more fond
of the layers pellets, hanging around during the chook's
feeding time and bullying the younger chooks away from the
feeder.  He snubbed his own high-fibre rabbit pellets,
although Boor'yall (Brenda's white silkie) gobbled them with
relish.
<p>
Just as long as they keep eating the grass I'll be happy.

Finishing up the materials for two talks I'll be giving at
Melbourne Perl Mongers this weekend.  It'll be good to have
the group up and running again.

Busy busy busy.  My there are a lot of things that are tax
deductable.  Busy busy busy.
