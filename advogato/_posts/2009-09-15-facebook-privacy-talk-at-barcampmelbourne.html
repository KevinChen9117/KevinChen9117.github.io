<p><b>Facebook Privacy talk at BarCampMelbourne</b><br>
This weekend at <a href="http://barcampmelbourne.org/">BarCampMelbourne</a> I gave a talk on Facebook privacy, and what information I was able to extract from the API using some reasonable simple Perl programs.  Due to the incredibly fast efforts of Avi Miller, this talk is now available on-line.  If you're reading this blog on <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/">my main blog</a>, then you can also watch it below:
