<p><b>SAGE-AU 2005</b><br />
I'm finally back from the SAGE-AU 2005 conference.  I presented two talks, one entitled <i>Conference Presentation Mind Control</i>, and a double-length one on <i>Starting a small (open-source) business</i>.
<p>
I discovered that SAGE-AU audiences don't laugh as much as local user groups.  At first I thought it was me, but this appears to be a comfort factor.  Local groups usually see the same crowd each month, and are a lot less formal than a national conference which meets once a year.
<p>
The best reactions to my talks have always been at Sydney Perl Mongers, and I attribute this primarily to the meeting being held in a rather nice pub.  I'll be expanding my presentation talk to recommend that if you can arrange for your audience to imbide alcoholic beverages during your presentation, they'll give you a better review than if presented with water.  Just don't expect them to remember the details of your talk afterwards.
