<p><b>KiwiFoo, StixCamp, Minifest, Sydney.pm, and more</b><br>
I have 9,000 unread messages in p5p.  I'm months behind on my blogging.  Some rapid catch-up is needed, so here it is for my blog... in executive bullet point style.

<p><b>Recent past:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>I made it to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi_Foo_Camp">KiwiFoo</a>.  It was awesome.  I have the T-shirt to prove it.
<li>I went to <a href="http://stixcamp.org/">StixCamp</a>.  High-speed wireless in a tent, and <i>amazing</i> food.
<li>Went to Sydney, and caught up with the <a href="http://sydney.pm.org/">Sydney Perl Mongers</a>, and <a href="http://martian.org/karen/">Karen Pauley</a> from <a href="http://perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a>.
<li>Went to <a href="http://www.manifest.org.au/">Minifest</a>, the Mini-Melbourne anime festival.
<li>Have been spending lots of time in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, where I've been doing some consulting work for an ISP.  This Friday I'm buying doughnuts for <i>Test Club</i>.
<li>Spoke at <a href="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/">LinuxSA</a> on cool new Perl technologies.  Awesome audience who laughed at my jokes and bought me pizza afterwards!  Thanks LinuxSA, you rock!
</ul>

<p><b>Recent future:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Flying back to Melbourne soon, and Canberra shortly after that for two more weeks of teaching.
<li>It looks like my teaching assignment in Saudi Arabia is going ahead, but to make the airfares affordable I'm going to have to spend a few days in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai">Dubai</a>.  Poor me.  ;)
<li>Both <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009/public/schedule/speaker/6640">Jacinta</a> and <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009/public/schedule/speaker/6631">myself</a> have had talks accepted for <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009">OSCON 2009</a>, in San Jose 20-24th July, 2009.
<li>I have to get my proposals in for <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/">YAPC Europe</a>.
</ul>
