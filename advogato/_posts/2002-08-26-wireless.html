<B>Wireless</b><BR>
Now the proud owner of a 18dBi connifer antenna.  Many thanks to Ian and Jacinta for their assistance in its de-installation from a neighbouring rooftop.  The previous owner had signed up for a one-month free trial of Galaxy-TV and then cancelled.  He thought it was great that he was being paid for an antenna that cost him nothing to start with.
<p>
I thought it was great that I didn't have to shell out lots of cash for a new antenna.  Big smiles all around.

<B>Work</b><BR>
AIIIIEEE!!  I'm everyone's favourite sysadmin, developer, technical writer, technical liason, trainer and advisor.  Even more than I was before.  Busy busy busy!

<B>Rabbit-proofing</b><BR>
The new office is mostly rabbit-proofed, with the exception of the phone-cable.  That'll need to be done soon, since Shadow has a fondness for telecommunications equipment.
