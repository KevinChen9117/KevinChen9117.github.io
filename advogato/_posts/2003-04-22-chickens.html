<B>Chickens</b><BR>
One of our chooks (not the broken one) appeared to have the chicken equivalent of hemorrhoids today.  I had the dubious experience of getting to push them back in.  We'll need to check they pop back out again tomorrow.  If they have, we'll probably need to use stronger medicine (eg, an axe).
