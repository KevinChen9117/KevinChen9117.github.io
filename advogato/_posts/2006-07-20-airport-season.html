<p><b>Airport Season</b><br />
Today I fly to <a href="http://perl.net.au/wiki/Canberra">Canberra</a> to teach <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/courses/perlsec.html">Perl Security</a>.
<p>
Tomorrow night I fly home from Canberra for the weekend.
<p>
On Sunday (two days later) I fly back to Canberra to teach <a href="http://conf.sage-au.org.au/speakers.html#m4abs">Perl for System Administration</a>.
<p>
On Monday night I fly back home again.
<p>
On Wednesday I fly to Canberra a third time for third time for the <a href="http://conf.sage-au.org.au/index.html">SAGE-AU conference</a>.
<p>
After the conference I fly back home again.
<p>
I will then have a whole month in Melbourne, before flying out to Canberra <i>again</i> to teach <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/courses/webdev.html">Web Development with Perl</a>.
<p>
After the web development course I'll be flying home, turning thirty, flying to cities that are <i>not Canberra</i>, and taking the rest of the year off.
