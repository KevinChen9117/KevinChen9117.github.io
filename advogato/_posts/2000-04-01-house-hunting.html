<B>House-hunting</b><BR>
Awoke with a snuffly nose which lasted all day, so I didn't
really feel like cycling all over Melbourne looking at
houses.  Despite this I did find a house with some potential
and in a good area.  Interestingly enough the house was
previously tennanted by some friends of Jacinta's.  This
could make a housewarming interesting.

<B>GnuCash</b><BR>
After many package installs I have GnuCash running at home. 
The latest CVS trees seem to have a problem with configure
if no --prefix= is set, but otherwise is working fine.  I've
started using GnuCash to track my finances.
<P>
I've never thought that accountants could possibly lead
interesting lives, but for some reason I've got a strange
urge to learn more about the art.  It must be a symptom of
the flu I've picked up.
<P>
Talking of accountants, my ex-landlord still hasn't called
back regarding where we're going to have dinner.  I'll have
to give him another call.
