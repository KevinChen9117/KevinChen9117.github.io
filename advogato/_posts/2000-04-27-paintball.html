<B>Paintball</b><BR>
Have a couple of good looking bruises from playing
paintball.  We played for about six hours, had lots of fun,
and went through way too much paint.  Jacinta got shot
across the knuckles which wasn't a very plesant experience,
but hasn't caused any permanent damage.

<B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
Wow, I received seven expressions of interest within minutes
of me posting around the staff list asking for Diplomacy
players.  Now I just need to find an external person to be
arbitrator for the electronic judge.

Version 0.18 is almost out the door.  I'd like to release it
this weekend.

<B>Work</b><BR>
Holidays are over, so I'm back at work.  I'd rather the
holidays had continued, but I guess we can't have
everything.
