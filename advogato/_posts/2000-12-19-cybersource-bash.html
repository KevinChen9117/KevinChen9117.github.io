<B>CyberSource Bash</b><BR>
<A HREF="/person/dancer">Dancer</a> invited me to the <A
HREF="http://www.cyber.com.au/">CyberSource</a> end of year
bash so I could catch up with him and generally hang out
with other geeks.  We caught up over a couple of scotch and
drys, and I also found myself bumping into some old
associates who I hadn't seem in quite some time.  All up I
had a very enjoyable time.
<P>
I'll be trying to find the time to send a letter or two off
to a couple of the CyberSource crew.  If nothing else I want
to better understand how they work, and if I end up doing
some work on the side I won't be dissapointed.
