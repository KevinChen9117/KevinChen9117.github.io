Looks like Jon is very happy with the article, and it's
currently on the printing presses now.   I've also got
permission to print the article on the <A

webpage</a>.

I'm sure that my Mom will be absolutely thrilled when I show
her the magazine.  :)

<B>House</b><BR>
Settlement in two weeks time.  The big stash of documents I
sent to the loan company seems to have dissapeared (they're
blaming it on the olympics), so I get the fun task of
cycling over to their Melbourne office today to drop the
documents off in person.
<P>
I haven't really even thought of home insurance yet.  I'm
hoping someone will throw a freebie at me for a few months
(not too unlikely).

<B>Chickens</b><BR>
Moving into the new house also means that I can keep
chickens, which I've decided to name after my friends (Ian,
Sofie, Ben, Tara, Daniel and Sarina).  This was going to be
a fairly simple operation, but the namesakes appear to have
become quite insistant as to which chicken breeds I purchase
and name after them.  Ben wants a Golden Silkie, Sofie
something cute (probably a Pekin), Sarina a Japanese
Bantam,  Daniel a Polish and Tara a Frizzle.  Ian's probably
been the best about this and just said he wanted a "brown
chook".

<B>Bike</b><BR>
Discovered why biscuit kept getting a flat back tyre.  I
found a large bulge that was only really visible when
inflated to riding pressures.  Replaced the tyre and all
seems much better.

<B>Work</b><BR>
I now have the position of Software Architect in the stats
team.  Fun fun fun.
