<B>Banking</b><BR>
Banks can really be a pain sometimes.  Personally, my banking matters are pretty simple.  There's a home loan offset account, which acts in many ways like a personal account, and there's a credit card (paid off in full each month), which makes every day purchases considerably easier.
<p>
Everything works pretty well, until you try to bank a foreign cheque.  The home loan just plain doesn't do foreign currency, at least they're honest about it.  The credit card (with a different financial institution) is happy about doing foreign currency, but their banking system doesn't allow them to put a 28 day hold on the funds from the foreign cheque -- something about bad software on their behalf.
<p>
As such, trying to deposit a foreign cheque to the credit card makes the bank uneasy -- I might spend those funds before the cheque has cleared, and that would be <i>terrible</i>.  I should note at this point that said foreign cheque is a bank cheque, not a personal cheque, and is covered in holograms and watermarks.  I usually point this out to the bank, along with the facts that I pay off the card every month, I never go near the credit limit, and I've never been refused for the dozen or so foreign cheques that I've banked previously.
<p>
Usually, after much talk up and down the chain of command, the cheque is finally deposited.  However sometimes it's refused.
<p>
Luckily for me, the following proceedure has always worked without fail:
<pre>
foreach bank
    foreach teller
        say "Hi, I'd like to deposit a foreign cheque to
             my credit card";
</pre>
Eventually, I'll hit someone who doesn't know there's supposed to be 15 minutes of ceremonial grieving by the bank before refusing, or just flat out doesn't care.  Usually I succeed after 1.2 branches.
<p>
The whole thing <i>does</i> get rather tiresome, and as the whole matter appears to be entirely discretional, is highly dependant upon branch/staff/managers.
<p>
I'm investigating alternative arrangements, the most useful of which would be an account in US dollars.

<b>Broody chook</b><br>
Broody chook is <i>still</i> broody.  It's been something like four weeks now.  If we weren't able to steal eggs from her each evening, she'd be sitting on a mound of about <i>eighty</i> eggs by now, trying to make them hatch.  Given that we don't have a rooster (and so the eggs aren't fertile), the whole thing is starting to get a little silly.  I'm even considering going and buying her some day-old chicks to break her out of her broodyness.
<p>
She stayed off the nest long enough today (to eat and dust bathe) that I could change the straw in the nesting area.  She had a huge sook about me doing that.
