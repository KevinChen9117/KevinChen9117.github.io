<B>Mouse drivers (rant)</b><BR>
My old scummy $10 mouse developed a problem with one of the buttons, and so a very nice friend donated me his old Microsoft Intellimouse (he's got some swish optical wireless thing now).  I plugged the mouse in and started using it under Linux without thinking much more about it.  However, on the rare occasions that I do use Windows, I noticed that the mouse wheel didn't work.  Today I thought I'd fix that.
<p>
It appears that while my $10 trash mouse could fit its driver on a floppy disk, to get a Microsoft Intellimouse to run you either need the CD that comes with it, or a 10Mb download from Microsoft.  10Mb seemed to be a lot for a mouse-driver, but it rapidly became apparant that it included all their mouse drivers, plus pictures of all the mice, plus advertising materials, a swag of different EULAs, and a few system files.
<p>
Installing the software required two reboots of the machine.  At the end, there's a walk-through showcase explaning how great your nice mouse is, filled with more pictures.  It even shows you a picture of the mouse it's installed thd drivers for so you can compare it to the one sitting under your hand.  Yup, that looks like my mouse.
<p>
Unfortunately, after all that, the wheel <i>still</i> doesn't work.  The Microsoft Mouse Troubleshooting Page concludes that my PS/2 port is incompatible with the mouse's scroll function.  Impressive that Linux is able to use the wheel without issue, given my hardware is supposedly broken.
<p>
The new drivers seem to be putting the mouse into a state where the wheel functions are disabled.  How do I know?  Because if I reboot into Linux from Windows without power-cycling the machine, the mouse shows all the symptoms of an incorrect driver (pointer jumps erratically and clicks erratically).
<p>
I suspect I'm going to see if there's a "generic ImPS/2 windows driver" out there, and use that rather than the 10Mb bundle of Microsoft stuff.
