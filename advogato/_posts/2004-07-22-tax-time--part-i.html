<p><b>Tax Time, Part I</b><br/>
For those people wondering, I keep both my personal and business books in <a href="http://www.gnucash.org/">GnuCash</a>.  This makes me different from just about every other person in Australia, who either doesn't keep track of their finances at all (most of the population), or shells out an incredible amount for a properitary accounting package.  I'm sure some businesses use the proprietary packages simply because that's what their accountants use.
<p>
I also have an accountant, but I use them for their knowledge, not for their book-keeping skills.  I have no idea if they've ever heard of GnuCash, however they're more than capable of understanding the reports that it can produce.
<p>
In today's exciting installment, I've finished reconciling my personal accounts up until the 16th June.  I'm almost at the point where I can close them off, prepare EOFY reports, and archive them.  Oh, and fill out some 40 pages of personal income tax return.
