<b>December 2004 diving Photos on-line</b><br/>
Some underwater photographs from our 2004 diving trip <a href="http://pjf.id.au/gallery/BCR2004/">are now on-line</a>.
<p>
I could have sworn that I edited them pretty heavily, but it seems I still ended up with 166 photographs in total.
<p>
The album software I'm using needs a few tweak.  In particular the return to index links will take you back to the first page (not usually what you want), and navigation links are not appearing on the top of the index pages.
<p>
The quality of photos varies somewhat, and many of the better ones are near the end -- our photography skills got better as time went on.
