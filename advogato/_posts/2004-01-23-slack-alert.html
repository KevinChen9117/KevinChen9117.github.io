<B>Slack Alert</b><BR>
I'm currently doing some routine maintenance on some clients machines.  Nothing unusual there.  What <i>is</i> particualrly nice is that it's a beautiful day, I'm comfortably reclining on the bed, I have streaming techno up far too loud, I have a big cup of tea next to me, and no wires connected to the laptop.  <a href="http://di.fm/">di.fm</a> is even playing a remix of one of the <i>Art of Noise</i> songs.  <i>Sweeeeeeet...</i>
<p>
It's not really slack.  A happy worker is a good worker.
