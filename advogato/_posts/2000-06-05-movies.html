Watched <I>LG-5: City in Space</i>, a 3D movie at the IMAX
theatre.  The special effects were good, but the plot wasn't
great.
<P>
Watched <I>Episode I: The Phantom Menace</i> on tape.  The
special effects were good, but the movie SUCKED!  George
Lucas has certainly turned to the dark side, I'm sure of
it.  I delayed watching TPM for a long time because everyone
else told me it was bad, but I had no idea just how truly
bad it was.  Somehow I feel that <A

Star Wars Christmas Special</a> had to have been better than
this.

Got heaps of coding done over the weekend.  Still needs a
lot of polish before the next release, but we're certainly
getting there.  Haven't heard back from Jon about The Perl
Journal article I'm supposed to be writing yet.  Will send
him another letter about it.
