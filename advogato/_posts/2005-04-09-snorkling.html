<p><b>Snorkling</b><br/>
Went snorkling under Rye pier, looked at wetsuits and made friends with the lovely lovely staff at <i>Aquatic Adventures</i>, who were generous enough to let us use their changerooms.  Would have loved to explore more of the pier than we did, but a forest of fishing lines made that too dangerous.
<p>
We had plenty of people on the pier interested on what was underneath, and we chatted somewhat about the local wildlife.  Given that all one really needs is a mask and snorkle, I'm surprised more people don't go exploring their piers.

<b>Trams</b><br/>
Discovered that Melbourne's tram stop displays run on Linux, as we caught one rebooting on the way home.  Jacinta was fast enough to catch a photograph of an upside down Tux before the display clearly started-up Xwindows.
<p>
As an interesting aside, the rail displays in Sydney run on Windows, as we caught one after a blue screen of death the last time we were up there.

I have no idea why my presence causes public transport IT infrastructure to malfunction.
