<B>Dogs and Sleep</b><BR>
Our neighbour has just got himself a dog, and its favourite
hobby seems to be barking from 4am to 7am outside Gwen's
window.  Gwen's been in Ballarat the last few days, but
she's going to get a bit of a surprise when she comes back.
<P>
The dog itself seems to be quite friendly and nice, albeit
probably quite bored.  Normally I don't mind barking dogs
too much, as I assume they give their owners more grief than
they give me.  However, when it's my immediate neighbour, I
do take exception.  I may have to invest in either a
chew-toy for the dog, some sound-killing earmuffs for me, or
some chocolates for Ian (so he won't mind when I ask to
sleep at his house where it's quiet).
<P>
Of course, my first line of attack is to have some quiet
words with our neighbour -- if I can stay awake that long.

<B>The Perl Journal</b><BR>
Wrote much of my draft last night, in preparation for first
submission this weekend.  Quite pleased.  It won't contain
how to roll your own F::Q module, as that looks like it will
be well beyond the scope of the article.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
The restructuring looks like it may be a good thing. 
Shirley, who's helping to organise things, certainly seems
to be more than willing to listen to people.  This is a good
thing.
<P>
I'm going to have to call a bunch of places looking into
having the Schoolsnet Xmas party on a boat, train, or other
vehicle.  I suspect I'm going to have to shift my spot on
the party committee to another Dev team member -- I want my
coding time, damnit.  :)
