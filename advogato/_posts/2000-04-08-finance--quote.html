<A HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/brentn>Brent</a>'s
TIAA-CREF patches have been merged into the Finance::Quote
source and a new version released.  It can be found on the
<A
HREF=http://www.sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=4232>Finance::Quote
webpage</a> as version 0.17.
<P>
I'll integrate the changes into GnuCash shortly.

Advogato's trust metric seems a little weird.  Previously I
was certified as an Apprentice.  Now more people have
certified me (all at either Apprentice or Journeyer) but my
rating has dropped down to Observer.
<P>
I guess I'm going to have to read <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/trust-metric.html>the document
on trust metrics</a> to figure out why a single
Certification from <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/dancer>Dancer</a> can
make me an apprentice, but 5 Journeyer/Apprentice
certifications can drop me back to Observer...  It all seems
very bizzare.
