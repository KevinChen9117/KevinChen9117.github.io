<p><b>Linux.conf.au, Day 1</b><br />
I've got a number of journal entries prepared to continue the report on my dive adventures, but I haven't finished of the processing of the photographs to go with them.  They'll be posted when I have a spare moment.
<p>
I've arrived in Sydney for <a href="http://linux.conf.au/">Linux.conf.au</a>, which is huge, and allegedly has 700-800 attendees.  Every session I've been to, including the keynote/welcome, has been packed, with numerous people standing or sitting on the floor.
<p>
The regular conference-goers are here, as well as Nat Torkington, whom I didn't expect.  I also shared a mini-bus from the airport with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Tanenbaum">Andrew Tanenbaum</a>.
<p>
I'm planning to spend much of the day in the hallway stream, although I'm attending a few of the presentations here and there.  I'm also posting what few photographs I take to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pfenwick/">flickr</a>.  I daresay that I'm both a poor photographer and a flickr newbie, so don't expect anything too amazing.
<p>
Tonight is the <i>speakers' dinner</i>, which is on a boat.  Tomorrow night is a party which I believe is sponsored by Google, Wednesday is the professional delegates and speakers' "networking session" (booze-up), and Friday night is the conference dinner.  I'm planning to sleep Thursday night in order to be awake before 6am for the "speakers' adventure".
