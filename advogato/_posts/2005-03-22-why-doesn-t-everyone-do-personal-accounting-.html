<p><b>Why doesn't everyone do personal accounting?</b><br/>
I think I've discovered why some people don't do personal accounting, and just look at their bank statements/balances each month to judge their financial position.  It's because spending half a day working through a huge pile of receipts, invoices, and statements is <i>dull</i>.
<p>
Dull dull dull dull dull.

Even so, I still find the benefits of personal accounting far outweighs the effort involved.  I'm not going to let a meager 2 inch stack of unprocessed papers stop me.
