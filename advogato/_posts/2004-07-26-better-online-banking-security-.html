<b>Better online banking security.</b><br/>
It's good to see that the <a href="http://www.bendigobank.com.au/">Bendigo Bank</a> is actually taking a huge step in the right direction for online banking services.  They're rolling out <a href="http://www.bendigobank.com.au/e-banking/e-banking_help/Customer_services/Security_options_order.shtml">one time password generators</a> to their clients.  These mean that internet banking authentication is no longer based upon something you know (your account ID) and something you know (your password), but instead the much more secure somethings you know (account/password) and something you have (security token).

The bank previously had these devices for their business customers who wished to perform large transactions.  However, my understanding is that they were only used for transactions (not login), and only the more expensive devices were available.  The move to making inexpensive ($20) tokens available to all customers is fantastic.
