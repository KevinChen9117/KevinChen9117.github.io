<B>New machine</b><BR>
Discovered that hard-drives can overheat as well, especially when you have four 7200 RPM drives all next to each other.  Enough heat buildup to fry an egg.  Shall be investing in a case fan and some mounting brackets to avoid thermal shutdowns.

<B>Junk that sells</b><BR>
Someone is buying my <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=2041023795">dead hard-drive</a> on eBay.  In fact, there's been two people bidding on it.  I wonder if it's because they've realised it's still under warantee?
