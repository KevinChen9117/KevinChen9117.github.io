<B>Stuff</b><BR>
Tons of stuff to write about, not enough time to do so.  Work is very busy.  Everything else is very busy.  I have no time.  Aiie!
<p>
<B>GnuCash</b><BR>
Compiled and installed <a href="http://www.gnucash.org">GnuCash 1.8.4</a> to celebrate the new financial year.  Gosh, does it look <i>sweet</i>.  It'll take me a while to setup the 2003-04 books in it, but it contains many, many features that I've been wanting for a long time.  My initial tests reveal that it should handle GST quite well, it happily keeps track of invoices (both ones that I've issued, and ones coming up), and if I set things up properly should take most of the work out of filling out tax returns.
<p>
My only fear is that it will move me from a cash-based system (money is counted when it actually enters/leaves the business) to an accurals based system (money is counted when an invoice enters/leaves the business).  A cash based system is slightly beneficial to the business when it comes to interest, so I'd like to stick with that.  Of course, I'm very interested in knowing what invoices have been served and what bills are coming up, but I want to ensure GnuCash can handle the entries being made in the GST tables when these move from accounts payable/receivable and into the appropriate categories.  I believe it can, but it's far too late at night for me to properly test.
