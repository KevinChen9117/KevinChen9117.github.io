<B>Backups</b><BR>
Tape drive still works a treat.  All machines on the network are very happy to connect to the machine with the tape-drive to do backups.
<p>
My next plan is to make a big storage machine (~240Gb in a RAID-5 configuration), and hang the tape drive off that.  Workstations will use the network storage whenever possible.  Keeping up-to-date backups for a single machine is much more attractive than many seperate machines.  I'm hoping I can do most of the set-up this weekend.
<p>
The next stage is to move the office to the 3rd bedroom (more space, better view), and put the noisy server machines in a cupboard or other out-of-the-way place.  Jacinta's workstation is the noisiest machine of all, containing four fans (1 x PSU, 1 x Case, 1 x CPU, 1 x GPU) all in the space of a small shoebox.  I don't know what I'll do to quieten it down.
