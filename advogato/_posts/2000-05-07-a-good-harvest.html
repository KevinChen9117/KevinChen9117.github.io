<A HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/lukeh>Lukeh</a> seems
to think that I'm related to some 'important historical
documents'.  I find this flattering, especially considering
that I don't believe I've ever actually met Luke personally,
although I believe almost every other person at Schoolsnet
has.
<P>
I'm looking forward to seeing Luke's documents, I'm quite
curious now.

Most of my <A

Artichokes</a> have died back for the winter, and so I took
the opportunity this weekend to harvest the tubers. I ended
up with a very large bucket filled with roots, and those
which I've tried have been delicious.  I'll definitely be
replanting these next time.
