<p><b>Ghostbusters</b><br/>
One of the television stations is running a <i>20 year anniversary</i> special of Ghostbusters (and Ghostbusters II).  Boy, I sure feel old now.  When I was a child I built my own ghostbusting paraphernalia -- we'd catch ghosts using equipment cobbled together from an old vacuum cleaner, turntable, and pram.  An evaporative cooling unit was used for containment.
<p>
We must have done a pretty good job, as I haven't heard of <i>any</i> ghosts hanging around my old suburb since that time.
