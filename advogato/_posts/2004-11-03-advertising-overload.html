<p><b>Advertising Overload</b><br/>
Our traditional forms of advertising
<a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a> have been
simple, direct, and relatively cheap.  A few words and special discounts
to usergroups and professional organisations, talking at conferences,
regular networking, referrals from satisfied clients, occasional
appearances in the media, a steady stream of traffic from Google searches.
These are effective, and rarely require any sort of financial commitment
on our behalf.  They've done a pretty good job of getting us clients.
<p>
However recently we've been spending real dollars to expand our
circle of influence.  The sponsorship of
<a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">OSDC</a> isn't because it gives
us a warm feeling by helping an open source conference, it's because
we expect to get bookings from it.  Some developers may have never
heard of <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">PTA</a> before.
Some of them will know about us, but may not have known that
we have a range of courses by Damian Conway open for enrollment.
Entirely different developers may know all that, but have never
actually heard Damian speak, and the conference will give them a
chance to encounter that first hand.  The sponsorship is an investment,
and we're hoping for a good return.
<p>
Today we were contacted by a developer-focused magazine that's
running a feature on training and certification.  They had a full-page
colour advertising space opposite the feature that they desparately needed
to fill due to a last-minute cancellation.  Normally we'd never
even consider taking our a full-page advertisement in this magazine,
the cost would be oppressive, but since they were so eager to have
the spot filled by close-of-business, we negotiated an acceptable deal.
<p>
So not only are we sponsoring a conference, we're running full-page
colour advertisements to 7,100 developers and IT managers, and we're
appearing in a different magazine talking about why Perl can hold
its own against Java, C#/.NET, and C++.  This is just for the
month of December, when we'll also be presenting at
<a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">the conference</a>,
running corporate training courses, and taking
a week off to go diving.  Crickey!
