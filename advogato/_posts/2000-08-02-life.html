<B>Life</b><BR>
Been very busy.  Gwen (Jacinta's sister and our housemate)
is now engaged.  I've probably been playing a little more
ADOM than normal, and this has affected my usual hobbies of
writing in my diary and getting my Diplomacy moves in on
time.  The weather has been polishing up quite nicely here
in Melbourne, and I've been spending more time in the
garden.  I'm once again reminded how much I'd like some more
land to grow things.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote drives artwork</b><BR>
A few bugfixes and minor releases because of that.  The most
interesting thing to eventuate is the use of Finance::Quote
to drive a dynamic art piece, the write-up of which can be
found <A
HREF="http://www.salon.com/tech/log/2000/07/17/stock_puppets"/>here</a>. 
The "stock-puppets" dynamically change depending upon the
mood of various world markets, and to be honest I'm quite
happy about this use of the module.  :)

<B>Work</b><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.advogato.net/person/scottp">Scott</a> is
away skiing and so I've been fielding most of his work as
well as mine.  This has made me <I>incredibly</i> busy
during work hours.
<P>
My discussions with Dan about me moving to a nine-day
fortnight seem to have broken down, and I'm rather
dissapointed by this.  Admittedly this is partially because
we've both been so busy, but the attitude seems to have gone
from "should not be a problem" to "we need you too much".
*sigh*
