<p>
It's been some time since I've written an entry of any reasonable size
in my journal.  There have been a few reasons for this, and work has been
one of them.  After the business experienced a one-week quiet patch
we spent some time on advertising and networking, and as a result
our work bucket is once again brimming.
<p>
Two weeks ago I spent my time in Perth, the world's most remote city,
teaching this quaint little language called Perl.  One of the attendees
was from New Zealand, which has a four-hour timezone difference to Perth.
It's not uncommon for us to have attendees from out-of-town, but usually
their original city is no longer than an hour's flight away.
<p>
Perth was very green, and the people there friendly.  I caught up
with some old friends from University who had moved there, and
attempted (with little success) to kick-start an informal get-together
of the Perth Perl Mongers.
<p>
After Perth came the inevitable catch-up on work from having been away
for a week.  I'm <i>still</i> catching up on <a
href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">YAPC::AU/OSDC</a> matters.
<p>
Our newest client is out near Clayton, which seems like the
world's second-remotest city when traveling there from the northern
suburbs.  While we were originally contacted regarding software
development, my time so-far has been predominantly systems focused.
<p>
As my journal entry yesterday suggests, I'm still having trouble
with <a href="http://www.commbank.com.au/">my old bank</a>.  I never
thought that closing an account would take longer than a month,
but in my case that appears to be the situation.  The bank is
trying to re-charge the fees they've agreed to refund, and the
matter is made worse by a classic "left-hand, right-hand" situation
where the relevant internal departments in the bank seem unable to
talk to each other.
<p>
I've invoked the disputes resolution process, and will be letting the
bank know of my intention to raise the matter to the banking ombudsman
should a satisfactory outcome not be rapidly forthcoming.  There's
practically no downside to me doing this.  The proceedures and
investigations from having the ombudsman involved are likely to
cost the bank much more than the disputed sum, and I have sufficent
documentation that I'm confident of a favourable recommendation.
<p>
One of the most pleasing aspects of the ombudsman process is that
the disputant is free to decline the recommendations of the ombudsman
should they wish.  The bank, on the other hand, must either accept
the recommendations, or risk being subject to a unconditionally
binding ruling from the ombudsman, so they have very little choice at
all.  As a bank manager friend of mine once said, "the banks hate the
ombudsman getting involved, because regardless of the outcome, the
bank will always lose."
