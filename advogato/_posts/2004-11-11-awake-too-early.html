<b>Awake too early</b><br/>
I woke up this morning before most of the cron jobs on the servers
I maintain.  That's much too early for my liking.  I've had a busy
week, and a busy day and weekend ahead.  Unfortunately that leaves
me with little time to write in my journal.
<p>
At least the training centre where I'm teaching today has half-decent
coffee.

On an unrelated topic, there's now a
<a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/toc.html">Table of Contents</a> of all
my journal entries, which extends way back before I started using
the system on <a href="http://use.perl.org/">use.perl</a>.
