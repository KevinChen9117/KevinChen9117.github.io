<B>Interesting Polls</b><BR>
I don't believe that on-line polls account for much, as they're unlikely to obtain a random sampling of the population, and are subject to a variety of biases by clever people.  Despite that, I still think the current trends at <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/polls/results.html">The Age newspaper on-line polls</a> are most interesting.

<b>Rabbit</b><BR>
I lied about the rabbit.  It appears he managed to find one of the monitors we had in storage, and chew through some of the attached cables.  Luckily, 15" CRT monitors with failing brightness aren't worth very much.
