<I>Warning:  This diary entry is really boring unless you
care about the board-game Diplomacy.</i>

<B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
It's been a long time since I've had a good game of <A
HREF=http://www.diplom.org/Welcome.html>Diplomacy</a>, and
so I briefly ventured over to <A
HREF=http://www.diplom.org/>The Diplomatic Pouch</a> to see
how the community was faring.  A while ago Hasbro purchased
Avalon Hill (the publishers of the game), and there was some
concern that <A
HREF=http://devel.diplom.org/Online/judge.html>on-line
games</a> might get the chop.  I'm glad to
see this wasn't the case.
<P>
Read an excellent article on <A
HREF=http://devel.diplom.org/Zine/F1999R/Debate/paradox.html>Eliminating
the Paradox in Diplomacy</a>, and skimmed over the <A
HREF=http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Zine/W1999A/Clarke/paradox_response.html>response</a>
to it.  Lots of good arguments on both sides, but I won't
mention them here.
<P>
I've been thinking of seeing if anyone's interested in
playing a low-turnaround Diplomacy game at work, with maybe
one `turn' (Move+Retreats) per week.  Ian keeps telling me
how much he loves strategy games, so I expect he will join.
