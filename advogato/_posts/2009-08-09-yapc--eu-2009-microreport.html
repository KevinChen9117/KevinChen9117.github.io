<p><b>YAPC::EU 2009 microreport</b><br>
I'm still travelling, and so I don't have a reliable sources of connectivity, time, or caffeine.  As such, this report is much briefer than I would like.
<p>
I made it to YAPC::EU 2009 and survived.  As my first YAPC ever, it was great to be at a conference where I could assume that everyone knew Perl.  It was also great to meet a number of the people who I'd been working with on-line for years, but never met in person.
<p>
It seems that lots of people use autodie.  That's good, because it's hard to gauge feelings and reactions on-line, but it's easy when a small group grabs one after a talk and asks detailed questions about its internals.  There seems to be a lot of demand for autodie to provide the ability for third-party code to see if it's enabled, and also a lot of demand (not least for me) for Perl to call a special method on exception objects if they're about to kill one's process, as opposed to be caught and handled.
<p>
The conference highlight for me were the people.  They were very warm, very willing to participate, and heckled only about things I could easily answer.  I suspect that means they were also being very nice, since they were a <i>very</i> knowledgeable audience.  Privately, everyone was extremely accommodating.  Apparently travelling from Australia makes one special, and I felt very special indeed from all the attention.
<p>
Looks like I'm out of time for this entry already.  I've got yet another flight tomorrow, so I'll try to squeeze out some writing on the plane.
