<b>A week away in Sydney (working)</b><br/>
Spent the last week in Sydney, presenting introductory Perl courses to a mixed class of students.  We had nine students, and I believe they were representing eight different organisations.  An interesting tidbit from the class is that the boarding passes used by my airline are printed and processed using Perl &mdash; I even got a peek at the source code.
<p>
Any class over eight students usually warrants a second trainer, and so I was fortunate enough to have Jacinta assisting me.
<p>
Normally when I travel for training I find myself with a little free time in the evening; however this particular trip had a busy social calendar.  One night was spent visiting some old friends who have recently had a child, and the other was spent with Sydney Perl Mongers.
<p>
Syd.PM certainly know how to have a good time, especially judging from <a href="http://perl.net.au/wiki/Image:Syd_pm_1.jpg">my grin in the photo</a>.  We had Robert Spier (from <a href="http://www.perl.org/">perl.org</a>) visiting, and to cap off the evening the New South Wales chapter of <a href="http://www.sage-au.org.au/">SAGE-AU</a> were also at the same pub.  When it got too late Jacinta had to almost drag me away, reminding me that I really did have to be up and teaching at 9am the next day.
<p>
As always, I'm very happy to be back at home, and I'm looking forward to a weekend where I'm not standing on my feet for 10+ hours a day.
