<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
A bit of hacking the last few days, mostly some well-needed
tweaks.  Volkers and Keith have recently written new modules
to do lookups at Deutsche Bank and UK funds, and these
should make it into the next release.  I'm very pleased.

The ASX seem to be doing some weird things with their
website.  I thought maybe they were intentionally objecting
to robot-type things, so I checked their <A
HREF="http://www.asx.com.au/robots.txt">robots.txt</a>
file.  Nope, nothing parsable there, just a really
misleading error message.  (Sorry guys, "Not Found" and
"High load, try again later" have different meanings in most
people's books.)

<B>The Perl Journal</b><BR>
My draft almost has all the sections filled in, and the
example program is finished and working well.  Hope to have
something reasonable to submit this weekend or early next
week.  Still needs polish, of course.

Friday already?  The week seems to have started just the
other day.

Dan and Tiff seem to be sick.  :(  I hope they're feeling
better soon.

X-COM III is great.  Loving it still.

Been drooling over some of the land available in <I>Earth
Garden</i> magazine.  49 acres in the middle of Queensland
for less than $AU 10K....  Mmmm, very tempting.  May have to
use a couple of tin-cans on a string for a network
connection, though.  Satellite downlink is also an idea.

Good to see that <A

started a diary.  Hi Bek!   Long time no see.
