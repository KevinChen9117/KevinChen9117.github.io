<B>Dead Machines</b><BR>
Looks like the machine with the dead power-supply ended up damaging its mobo as well.  While the machine is running again, it's very unstable, often rebooting with no good reason whatsoever.  Looks like I'll need to be getting some more hardware.  AFAIK Ian has sold off all his old PCs, so I may have to use another source.

<B>Apricots</b><BR>
Had a large branch drop off our apricot tree the other day.  This is the second time in three years.  I suspect we'll have to prune the tree rather than have it lose large bits every time it produces a bumper crop.

<B>Work</b><BR>
Yes, working on a Sunday.  I don't want to think about work, but I am.  Very much looking forward to the break I'm getting in a few months time.
