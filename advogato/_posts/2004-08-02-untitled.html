A few exciting things today on the <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a> front:
<ul>
<li>We opened bookings for our new <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/perlsec.html">Perl Security</a> course.
<li>We opened bookings for Damian's <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/aooperl.html">Advanced Object Oriented Perl</a> and <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/textproc.html">Text Processing with Perl</a> courses.
</ul>
<p>
Our list of <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/bookings.html">courses open for booking</a> is now pleasingly long.
