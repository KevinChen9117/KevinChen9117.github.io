<p><b>Around the world with Perl</b><br>
I've just finished my trip to the USA, which included adventures in Portland and San Francisco/San Jose and surrounds.   I had a blast at OSCON, and will post memoirs soon.  Right now I'm about to board a plane, fly back to Melbourne, do a stack of paperwork, and then fly off to Europe for YAPC::EU.
<p>
A huge thanks to everyone who brought me goodies, showed me around, took me adventuring, let me crash on their couch, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juliancash/3758284452/in/set-72157621663915357/">took photographs</a>, brought me food, gave me hugs, listened to my talks, commented on my talks, cycled back from hiking, took me to ice-cream, or any of the above.

More blogging when I arrive back in Australia.  ;)
