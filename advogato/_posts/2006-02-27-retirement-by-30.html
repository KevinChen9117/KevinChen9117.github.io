<p><b>Retirement by 30</b><br />
I've been talking about early retirement for years.  I'm sure this has been a source of great amusement for friends, family, and peers.  Given that the start of my third decade of life will be happening later this year, I thought I should give a status update about how I'm going.
<p>
Retirement, in the sense of 'never need to work another day of my life', simply is not going to happen in the next six months.  That's okay, because retirement in the sense of 'only need to work fifteen days a year' has already happened.  Yes, that includes covering all our diving expenses and a modest amount of savings.
<p>
After many years of working insanely hard, I'm finally at the point where I can get some relaxation.  The factors involved in this are simple.  Sound investment plans, sound business management, and sound lifestyle management.
<p>
I'm expecting to continue to work more than my required 15 days/year, primarily as a form of insurance.  However for the moment I'm mostly working on maximising my standard of living, rather than maximising my total income.  It's a very, very satisfying state to be in.
