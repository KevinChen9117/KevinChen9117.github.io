<B>Visitors</b><BR>
Gwen (Jacinta's sister) and her fiancee are down from sunny Mackay (Queensland) and are staying the evening.  Even though our rabbit made good friends with Gwen, he's now sorely miffed because they're staying in <i>his</i> room, and have the door shut against the Melbourne winter.
