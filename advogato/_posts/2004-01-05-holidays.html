<B>Holidays</b><BR>
Goodness, it's awful coming back to work from holidays.  Work is good -- after all, I set my own conditions and hours -- but having free time is _so_ nice.

What I really want to do right now is hack code because I want to hack code, not because it's required for some project I'm working on.  That would be lovely.

I should stop trying to work on this client contract.  But being distracted is so much better than reading legalese.
