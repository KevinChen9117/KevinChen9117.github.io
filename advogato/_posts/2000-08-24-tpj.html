Jon seems quite happy with my draft, and has given me a
green-light to go ahead with a second article.  I'm most
pleased.

In true perl hacker's fashion, my journal article is also
its own formatting program.  Running perl over it turns it
into editor-in-chief friendly format, whereas leaving it
as-is turns it into author-preferred format.  :)
