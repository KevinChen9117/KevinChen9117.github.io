<p><b>Business/Life Design</b><br/>
It's finally official.  After almost four years of providing system administration services, I'm finally out of the game, and this is a joyous occasion.  It seems ironic that <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl <i>Training</i> Australia</a> was doing so much system administration, but I had lots of contacts in the industry, and lots of work available to me.
<p>
All the SysAdmin work that I was performing is now being handled by Daniel's new business, <a href="http://www.digital-infrastructure.com.au/">Digital Infrastructure Solutions</a>.  Daniel's been doing practically all the work anyway, but this provides him with many more opportunities to grow his business.  Most importantly, it means that I can now work on training and course development full-time.
<p>
One of my most startling discovers is that I can now plan my entire life using a Gantt Chart.  That's something I've never been able to do before, and I wholeheartedly look forward to it.
<p>
We're still in the game of providing specialist development and consulting services, and of course we're doing more training than ever before.  If you're used to booking us in advance for development or consulting (rather than calling up whenever your machine has problems), then you'll find little has changed.  If you have an espresso machine in your office, then you're especially welcome to keep throwing work our way.
<p>
<b>Website Design</b><br/>
Jacinta and myself are in the process of modernizing <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">our website</a>.  The old site uses HTML 4.01 and CSS, is built using a batch process, is completely static, and uses colours I can't see.  The new site uses XHTML strict and CSS, runs on top of Mason and Class::DBI, and still uses colours I can't see.  The new site is almost at the point we can make it live, but I've got a number of usability improvements I still wish to make.
<p>
The moral of the story is that if you're going into business, pick colours that you can see for your logo, especially if you're the one who has to maintain the website.
