<p><b>Screen repaired</b><br />
A few days ago the techniction from Dell arrived with my new LCD screen.  Everything went just fine, and there were no complications in replacing the display.
<p>
Turns out that the tech lives in just the next suburb, and happens to be an anime fan who wanted to learn more about Unix operating systems, so we had lots to talk about.  Having recently attended Software Freedom Day I had a big bag of live CDs and other goodies to help him along.
<p>
Seems that I'm not the only one who has had problems with the Inspirion E1705/I9400 display.  The tech claimed that he had already replaced three of them before my visit at 11am.
