<B>Desk-space</b><BR>
Scotty has a huge amount of collected stuff that he keeps on
his desk.  It's stored in a more sorted fashion than the
stack-based system that I use, but there's a problem that
Scott doesn't seem to have enough desk space for his needs. 
Occasionally Scotty things drift over to my beautiful,
clean, pristine desk-space that I haven't fouled with
8-month-old bug notes.  I don't think Scott's realised that
my little line of candles, chocolate, hackey-sacks and
business-cards-cubes actually marks my territory, but it
does.  I had to move a server off my desk today.

<B>Sam</b><BR>
Sam hasn't gone home yet.  Neither have I.  But Sam doesn't
have a good excuse.  He's probably still working, he's not
drunk, and he's not exhausted from hackey-sack or recovering
from Indian.

<B>Rock-climbing</b><BR>
Karen, our temp-secretary, is going to come rockclimbing
with us on Sunday.  This is very good.  Karen's very nice,
but it's a shame she's stuck in a temp-secretary job.  She's
got a lot more skills than that, but her visa stops her from
working in any one spot for too long.

<B>Life</b><BR>
It's a shame we only get one of them each.  Life's so good
I'd really like to have three lives -- like in pacman. 
Anyone have any paths to immortality?
