<B>Smoking and thanks</b><BR>
I'd like to thank <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/fozbaca>fozbaca</a> for
his tips and how things look from the smoker's side of
things.  Unfortunately Kathryn tells me that she's given up
on giving up, which is a shame -- a week and a half with no
cigarettes is a very good start.
<P>
If Kathryn does decide to start again, I can feel safe in
the knowledge that I won't put any deadlines in front of
her.  Kathryn's job, as a member of the Support team, is to
put work in front of me.  (I've been doing a good job of
dodging it, though.)

<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Linas has greatly increased the traffic on the mailing list
with some great ideas about historical quotes and non-http
quotes.  I've got lots of good things to be thinking about
now.  Linas even wants to do the web-page. I'm a happy boy.

<B>Work</b><BR>
The company sponsored pizza, the employees purchased a huge
amount of drinks, and a good time was had by all.  I even
played a little <A

quickly
stopped because Windows is just so damn annoying.  That and
Natedawg is too good and keeps whipping my butt.
<P>
Monday is a public holiday (yay!), and Tuesday Dan is due
back.

<B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
My goodness, due to popular demand we're going to start a
<i>third</i> play-by-e-mail <A
HREF=http://www.diplom.org/>Diplomacy</a> game here at
work.  It's amazing how much people are getting into it. 
Sometimes I think Ben speaks the truth when he says that
I've destroyed productivity with my silly strategy games.
