<B>Support Fun</b><BR>
Today the support team had one of the best customer
complaints in a while.  They complained that the load on the
proxy server was too low.  :)
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Another week over.  Many changes.  <a href="/person/Dancer/">Dancer</a>
is leaving the end of next week, and I've rather
surprisingly decided to take the role of designing and
helping to implement a new stats system.  I'm also really
going to be moving to a nine-day fortnight this time. 
<P>
<B>House</b><BR>
The nice house near Ian and Sofie is subject to flooding,
but we're not sure what type of flooding.  Checking up with
Melbourne water and looking for signs of flood damage
tomorrow.

<B>Games</b><BR>
Gamma on my S3 Virge is very low, and there seems to be NO
way to change it.  This makes playing X-COM very dark.  Too
dark.  Not happy.
