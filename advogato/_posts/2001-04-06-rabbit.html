<B>Rabbit</b><BR>
Went through two phone cords today thanks to Shadow.  The 
first time we sliced through the cord moving the fridge so 
we could get Shadow out from behind it, and the second time 
Shadow bit through the cord seeing if it was good to eat.
<P>
Shadow is completely toilet trained, except for the little 
mess in the laundry that missed the litter tray, and the 
little mess in the lounge room.  He <I>is</i> toilet 
trained insofar that he hasn't made a mess of the carpet 
yet, although that might be by luck rather than design.
<P>
Shadow has decided that I'm a good person to have around 
when it comes to cats, dogs, and other scary things.  Today 
he heard Jimmy (<a href="/person/kevinl/">kevinl</a>'s dog) and rather 
than running under cover he ran back to sit next to me.  I 
feel quite useful.  :)
<P>

Actually did some code clean-up yesterday, although I have 
a big backlog of mail to get through.  Sorry to everyone 
who's sent me comments, code, or ideas and hasn't heard 
back from me yet.  I am getting there.
<P>
Felt <I>very</i> pleased with myself when apt-get found and 
installed F::Q today.
