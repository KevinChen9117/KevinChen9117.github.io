<p><b>A day off</b><br/>
One of the nice things about running your own business is that after a long week in Sydney, and a busy weekend, you can choose to take the Monday off and have a long weekend.  That's the theory, anyway.
<p>
The trouble is that even if you take a day off, the rest of the world keeps working.  In the period of 9am - 11am I've accquired a new potential client, confirmed two off-site appointments, and had a phone-call letting me know of a machine compromise at a client.  Thankfully the compromise was rapidly contained and cleaned.
<p>
Given that works seems to have found me, I'm going to spend a few hours catching up on paperwork (relatively relaxing), and try to see if I can finish work early.
