<p><b>$?, system() and win32</b><br />
<i>Warning: Technical post ahead.</i>
<p>
I've been working on improvements to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?IPC::System::Simple">IPC::System::Simple</a>, and discovered a tricky problem while writing more test cases.  Put very simply, when using <tt>system()</tt> under Windows I'm unable to tell the difference between a command that we can't find, and one that we <i>can</i> find, but returns an exit value of 1.
<p>
The problem is two-fold.  Firstly, whenever we invoke a shell to spawn a process, we can't ever tell the difference between the shell returning a "can't start" value, and a command that runs successfully and returns the same value.  This isn't a problem that's unique to Windows; the "can't start" value is 1 under Windows, and 127 under Unix.
<p>
The second problem is Windows-Perl specific. If it fails to start the command successfully, it tries to invoke it using the shell, <i>even if the multi-argument version of <tt>system()</tt> is used</i>.  This means that under Windows we can <i>never</i> tell the difference between a failed command and a completed command returning -1.
<p>
I suspect that Perl invoking the shell when using a multi-arg <tt>system</tt> call is a bug.  If not, then it needs to be explicitly documented.  Time for me to fire up perlbug again.
<p>
In the meantime, I can get around most of these things problems in IPC::System::Simple by falling back on the Win32::Process module.  This is almost certainly the correct solution regardless of what happens with Windows <tt>system()</tt>, since it allows us to access the full 16-bit return value, something that <tt>system()</tt> will never do.  Unfortunately it means that I need to do a lot of the work by hand that would normally be handled in Perl's win32.c, and I'm not really looking forward to that.
