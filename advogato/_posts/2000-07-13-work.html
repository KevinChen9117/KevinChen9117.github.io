<B>Work</b><BR>
After a small discussion on slashdot I realised that if I
were to take up contracting and work 1-2 days a week on
average, I could happily maintain my current lifestyle
(although I won't really be saving any money).  This seems
incredibly attractive, as a 5-day weekend every week would
give me lots of time to do more fulfilling things than
writing code for someone else.  I'll need to sit down and
figure out all the pros and cons of this scenario.

One, maybe two bits of documentation to go, and some easy
code changes and testing.  While the next release could be
happily called version 0.19, I'm considering bumping it up
to 1.00 because I now consider it stable, good, and
flexible.  A 0.xx number always seems to imply "under
development", whereas the core of F::Q has matured quite a
bit.
