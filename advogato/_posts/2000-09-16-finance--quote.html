Version 1.02 is released and available for download.  I'm
very pleased to say that the number of information sources
is steadily rising.  Volker Stuerzl and Keith Refson both
have modules that are being released in this version.  Good
work and congratulations to both!

The server at Sourceforge that hosts the F::Q webpage seems
to be rejecting ssh connections.  That makes it rather
tricky to update the webpages.  :/
