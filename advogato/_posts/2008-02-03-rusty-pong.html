<p><b>Rusty Pong</b><br>
I've got more writing about <a href="http://www.linux.conf.au/">linux.conf.au</a> to
finish, but in the meantime I thought I'd amuse you with a
video I made of "Rusty Pong" as demonstrated at LCA 2008.
<p>
For those who aren't reading this from <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/">my main blog</a>, or otherwise
can't view the embedded video, you can also <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfiXCY55qU">find it on
youtube</a>.
