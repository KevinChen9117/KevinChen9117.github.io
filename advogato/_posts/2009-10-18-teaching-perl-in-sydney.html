<p><b>Teaching Perl in Sydney</b><br>
I've just spent the week teaching Perl in Sydney.  It was good.  Actually, it was <i>really</i> good.  My class were close in ability, asked intelligent questions, thought through problems, asked for assistance when needed, quizzed me about advanced topics during the breaks, and generally showed themselves to be awesome.  It felt just like the good ol' days.
