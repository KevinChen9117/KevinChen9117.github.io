<p><b>Teaching Perl in Saudi Arabia</b>
After what seems like an almost endless amount of paperwork, visa applications, immunisations, negotiations, contracts, travel agents, and administrivia, I'm about to fly to Saudi Arabia, to teach Perl to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Aramco">the world's biggest oil company</a>.
<p>
Why are they learning Perl?  Well, as best I can tell, they're using it for data munging of geological data.  That's got a familiar ring to it, in fact I've been seeing a big growth of <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=566">Perl in Geoscience</a> recently.
<p>
On the way back I'm planning to spend a couple of days in Dubai, just because it sounds like such a bizarrely opulent part of the world.  World's biggest hotel.  World's biggest indoor ski slope.  World's biggest shopping mall, and certainly the closest thing we have to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/guide/magrathea.shtml">Magrathea</a>, with Dubai creating artificial islands in the shapes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Islands">palm trees</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_(archipelago)">the world itself</a>.  I also hear the diving is pretty good.
