<b>In praise of AnnoCPAN</b><br />
I've become increasingly fond of <a href="http://www.annocpan.org/">AnnoCPAN</a>, an annotated version of the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">Comprehensive Perl Archive Network</a>.  AnnoCPAN has rapidly become my scratchpad for writing down notes, explanations and reminders regarding modules.
<p>
AnnoCPAN is automatically linked to from each module on CPAN, so I'd think that more people are aware of it.  However my experiences at conferences and user-groups may suggest otherwise.
<p>
<b>Tidyview</b><br />
<a href="http://perltidy.sourceforge.net/">Perltidy</a> is a fantastic tool for reformatting Perl code.  I'm impressed at its abilities, even when I think my code is beautiful, perltidy can often make it <i>more</i> beautiful.  Whenever I've been called to help maintain code that was written by the style impaired, perltidy has been an essential tool.
<p>
Leif Eriksen has recently released <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tidyview">tidyview</a>, a graphical tool for adjusting perltidy options.  This allows one to see visually see what all the perltidy options do, without having to go through the manual process of run-and-compare yourself.
<p>
I understand that tidyview is still beta, and has a few dependencies that Leif expects to remove for final release.  However it's still impressive in what it can do so far.
