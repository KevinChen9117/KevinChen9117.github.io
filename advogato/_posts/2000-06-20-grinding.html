<B>Grinding</b><BR>
Ben showed me a short video of skateboarders who didn't
quite make
their tricks.  I think councils who don't want skaters
hanging around would do well to take a look at this video. 
Rather than putting up signs saying "No skating, fine $200",
they could instead put up signs saying "Grinding a bar and
failing could permanently separate you from your
reproductive organs."  Any desire I had to do skateboarding
tricks completely drained away from me after watching Ben's
short vid.
