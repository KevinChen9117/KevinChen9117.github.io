<p><b>Linux.conf.au 2009</b><br>
I'm sitting on a pristine beach.  Nearby, a bee that's almost the
size of my thumb lazily makes its way between the fragrant violet
flowers on the tree that provides my shade.  The sun is warm,
but not too hot, and a few small sailing craft are out on the
water, enjoying the mild weather and light winds.  Beyond the
water a breathtaking range of mountains rise.  In the water,
a wetsuited man swims to a nearby moored boat, while nesting
gulls swoop him from overhead, and a flotilla of ducks cautiously
follow, hopeful for an easy meal.
<p>
You'd be excused to think that I was on holidays, but actually
I'm at <a href="http://linux.conf.au/">Linux.conf.au</a> (LCA), which this
year is being held in Hobart, Tasmania.  Tasmania has always been
known for its breathtaking landscapes, pristine wilderness, and
excellent beer.  Having spent the last week here, I can assure you
that Tasmania has all these things in abundance.
<p>
Like most conferences, one has to make a choice at LCA: talks,
social, sleep; pick two.  Since I fell into my usual bad habit of
working on my slides and presentations during the conference period,
I was really only able to pick one; in this case, I picked social.
<p>
This year I seem to be a lot more trendy than I'm used to, and this
was even before I gave my talks.  I've been invited to the exclusive
dinners, I was readily included in conversations with authors of
famous books and software, and there was a most touching moment where
one of the local University of Tasmania students told me that he
managed to get a number of registrations based purely upon my
<a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=525">lightning talk from last year</a>.
<p>
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~jarich/journal">Jacinta</a> had the first talks for the conference, both of which
occurred on the Monday LinuxChix mini-conf.  Her talk
<i>On Speaking</i> had the audience in rapture and easily
rates as one of the best talks, if not <i>the</i> best talk I
saw at the entire conference.
<p>
For my talks, I had one scheduled presentation, and
<i>three</i> unscheduled ones, one of which was a lightning
talk.  The other two talks were due to a speaker giving notice
of a late cancellation, and I happened to have a few talks that
were ready to go.
<p>
For my fill-in talks, I gave my talk on
<a href="http://lca2009.linux.org.au/programme/schedule/view_talk/228"><i>The Art of Klingon Programming</i> and 
<i>What's New in Perl 5.10</i></a> (heavily revised from the
talk I gave before 5.10 was released).  Some vanity searching
revealed some excellent feedback with regards to these talk,
which I'm really happy with, because they weren't as polished
as I would have liked them to be.
<p>
My main talk was <a href="http://lca2009.linux.org.au/programme/schedule/view_talk/175"><i>Awesome Things You've Missed in Perl</i></a>,
discussed a range of new Perl technologies, many of which have
only been written in the last two years.  My lightning talk was a small mention of <a href="http://petdance.com/ack/">ack, a better grep</a>, which ended up winning one of the (three) awards for best lightning talk.  Next year I'm going to have to give a lightning talk on how to give good lightning talks.
<p>
The most newsworthy event (at least by local media standards) was
the Penguin Dinner.  As is the custom, we had a charity auction at dinner,
in this case to raise money for the <a href="http://www.tassiedevil.com.au/">Save The Tasmanian Devil foundation</a>.
Part-way through the bidding process, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bdale_Garbee">Bdale Garbee</a> made a commitment
to shave his beard if the money raised was more than a certain
amount.  While I wasn't able to keep track of all the pledges and contributions, the result was a final amount of money raised that approached
the $40,000 AUD mark, and Bdale lost his beard.
