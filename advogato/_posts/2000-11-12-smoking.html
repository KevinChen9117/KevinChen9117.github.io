<B>Smoking</b><BR>
Kat's giving up smoking, not having had a cigarette in four
days now.  She's holding me to my promise to sponsor her for
$2/week for a year, with her paying me back double if she
starts again.  Gill's also giving up.  This is excellent
news, I like my friends and workmates not smoking.  :)
