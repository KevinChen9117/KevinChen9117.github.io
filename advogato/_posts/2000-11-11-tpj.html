<B>TPJ</b><BR>
Yay, issue #19 is finally on the web.  This means I finally
get to read <a href="/person/mojotoad/">mojotoad</a>'s article, as well as
my own of course. :)

<B>Climbing</b><BR>
Went rock-climbing for the first time in ages today.  My
fingers and arms are a little sore, but the mexican
afterwards sure
tasted good.  Got to see Dan G who I haven't seen
in ages and had been missing.  Chatted to him lots about
geeky things like Java, roguelike games, PBMs, and ducks. 
Good fun.
