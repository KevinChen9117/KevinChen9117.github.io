<B>Time</b><BR>
I love spending time doing all sorts of things, but I never
seem to be able to get enough of it.  Friends, food, coding,
a life, family, geeky things, sleep -- I want time for them
all.
<P>
Back when I was a student I used to run on a 25 hour day. 
This was very good, because I'd always have that extra hour
to do things in.  I can't do this anymore, because I need to
come in at a semi-reasonable time for work.
<P>
Am going to try and crystalise a number of ideas in my head
into code, despite it being past my bedtime of 10:30.  I'm
really going to have to find a way to do more open-sourcey
things at work.  I'm a sucker for people sending me patches.
<P>
<B><I>Addendum</i></b><BR>
Stayed up until sometime in the morning hacking at
Finance::Quote.  I've got a working framework for proper
failover, loadable module support, and more configurable
objects.  Plus I think I can keep everything compatible with
the old calling syntax with just a little work.  This makes
me all very happy.
<P>
The changes aren't in the CVS tree yet, because they're not
finished and break just about everything.  I want to clean
them up and gain comments from the other developers before I
put them back in the main branch.  In the meantime I might
put them on an experimental branch.
<P>
If I were a few years younger I'd probably pull an
all-nighter to convert everything over to the new harness,
but at the ripe old age of 23 I'm finding I need my sleep. 
In any case I'm still a very happy coder.
