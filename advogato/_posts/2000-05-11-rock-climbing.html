<B>Rock-climbing</b><BR>
Went rockclimbing with a bunch of people, including <A
HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/rcp>Ross</a>.  I managed
to
make the finger-breaking climb that Ian did last week, and
Ross showed excellent potential starting his climbs at a 12.

<B>Diplomacy</b><BR>
The two Diplomacy games are going well, with the first one
clipping along nicely and the second one starting to roll
into action.
