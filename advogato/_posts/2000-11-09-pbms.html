<B>PBMs</b><BR>
Got in contact with Peter Read of Dynamic Games, who really
got me into PBMs and lots of other tactical and strategic
games when I was about 12 years old.  The game that I was
thinking of was called "Warboid World", and no, it's no
longer being run.
<P>
I'm hoping to convince Peter to let me have a stab at
resurrecting Warboid World and some of the other PBM games
that I remember from my youth.  These could hopefully be
re-released as Open Source to be run in a more
Internet-aware enviornment, using an E-mail or web interface
to play the games.  I feel this is much better than the
games dying out completely.
