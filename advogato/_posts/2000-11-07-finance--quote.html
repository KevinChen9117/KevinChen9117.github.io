1.04 (minor bugfixes) is out so that people will stop being
scared by a couple of oddities in the test suite.  Having
hit the SourceForge top fifty also makes me feel good.
<P>
Jon Orwant wants me to write another TPJ article.  Got to
get a draft to him by the end of this week.

<B>Lazy Days</b><BR>
Had Fri, Sat, Sun and Tues off work.  My goodness it's been
fabulous.  I've been spending my time cycling around what
must be some of the most beautiful parts of Melbourne,
learning how to do fun things with power tools at the new
house, and generally having a very relaxing time.  I really
don't want to go back to work -- I want to be a student
again with those endless summer holidays.

<B>Play By Mail</b><BR>
For some reason I've had an incredible urge to play a very
old PBM game I used to play back in my youth.  The game was
run by Peter Read of Dynamic Games, and I can't remember the
name, except that it involved robots and a hexagonal map and
bases and tunnels and a sensor net and stuff.  Different
robots had different powers -- some could build new sensors,
some were good at fighting, some were fast, some could build
tunnels, some could sense tunnels being built, and some very
special ones could even make use of Satellite Orbital Lasers
at blat things from a distance.
<P>
Unfortunately, after a fair bit of searching, I couldn't
find anything that looked like the game, nor do I know where
my old rule-booklets are.  I could try re-writing it based
upon my memories of it from about 10 years ago, and wait
until either (a) I get a cease-and-desist from some laywers,
in which
case I've found the original game, or (b) I finish it and go
looking for players.
<P>
I don't suppose anyone else can remember the game at all? 
If you do, please drop me a mail (pjf at CPANdotORG), I'd
very much appreciate hearing from you.
