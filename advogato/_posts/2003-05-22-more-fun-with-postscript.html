<B>More fun with postscript</b><BR>
<blockquote>
To put two pages on one sheet (of A4 paper), the pagespec to
use is:
<blockquote>
2:0L@.7(21cm,0)+1L@.7(21cm,14.85cm)
</blockquote>
-- pstops man page
</blockquote>
<p>
Luckily for most mortals, there's psnup which works just as well but with less pain.  (What I was actually after was "pstops 2:0+1" to interpose pages on top of each other).
