<B>Olympics</b><BR>
Okay, I've had a few drinks, and I'm watching the winter
olympics closing ceremony.  Having an oh-so-funky loungeroom
PC means that I can share my thoughts with the rest of the
world.
<p>
<I>Dinosaurs</i><BR>
Giant plastic skeletons (with <i>no</i> lip sync) <i>and</i>
KISS immediately afterwards...  Please, gimme a break.  Some
<i>original</i> comedy for the dinosaurs would have been good.
<p>
I'll pay KISS.  We resurrected some really ancient artists
for our closing ceremony in Sydney.
<p>
<I>Earth, Wind and Fire?</i><BR>
By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet!
<p>
I'd never heard of these guys before.  I assume they're a
late 80's group, since their music sounded the same as
everything else from that era.
<p>
<I>Pyrotecnics attached to skates</i><BR>
Okay, *that* was cool, and definitely illegal in Australia.
<p>
<I>Harry Conneck Jr</i><BR>
Most people n Melbourne associate him with a train company
now.  Most people who use the trains don't even remember who
he is.
<p>
<I>Tap-dancing</i><BR>
Had to have microphones in the shoes.  <I>Get Smart</i>, eat
your heart out.
<p>
<I>Pretend rap?</i><BR>
There's some group playing now who look like rappers who
want to be jazz players, and are failing with both.  One of
those all-male groups.  I think that expecting the olypmics
to play good coding music is too much to ask for.  (Yes, I
code to Run-DMC, so shoot me.)
<p>
<i>More dinosaurs</i><BR>
Lame lame lame!  We had giant clotheslines.  Much more
original.  :)
<p>
<i>Cleaning the ice</i><BR>
Sounds like a captain planet song to me.  Jacinta likes it.
 Her musical tastes are still stuck in the 80s.  I don't
know who this Wayne dude is, but he seems to be okay at
skating.  Of course, being the winter olympics, you'd expect
a few decent skaters to be around.
<p>
<b>Interlude - Gold for Australia</b><BR>
We won <i>two</i> gold medals at the winter olympics, the
first two gold medals <i>ever</i> for Australia in the
winter olympics.  Aussie Aussie Aussie!  Oi! Oi! Oi!
<p>
<i>Temptation Island</i><br>
Australian Temptation Island is starting as of next week. 
Personally I don't give a hoot about the show, but it's
traditionally been followed by Buffy, to whom I give many
hoots.  Buffy rocks.
<p>
<b>More Olympics</b><br>
Steve Bradbury is carrying the Australian flag.  Everyone
know Steve, he won the speed-skating.  He's had an awfully
good sense of humour about it all.  Did I mention that
Australia won two gold medals?
<p>
<i>Flags</i><br>
Winches?  <i>Winches?</i>  Back in my day you had to pull
the rope
and tie it off at the end.  Operating the winch looks like
harder work anyway.
<p>
<i>Dinosaurs</i><br>
Shame shame shame.
<p>
<i>Lighting</i><bR>
I'm impressed with the ability to light up the whole stadium
with such clarity.  There must be some very good projection
units there.
<p>
<i>Dinosaurs</i><BR>
When I die, I'm doing the organ donation thing, *and/or* the
medical students in Sydney slicing me up for their
undergraduate degrees.  I don't have a problem with that. 
However, I want it recorded that I *do* object to being
re-animated for an olympic event.
<p>
<i>Security</i><br>
I think this has been the first olympics ever where both the
armed forces and the residing security have been thanked for
their efforts.
<p>
<b>G'night</b><br>
It's certainly time I should get some sleep.  G'night all. 
Make sure that you use your powers for good and not evil.
