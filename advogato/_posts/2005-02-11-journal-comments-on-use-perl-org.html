<p><b>Journal comments on use.perl.org</b><br/>
After much time wondering why my <a href="http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=display">use.perl  journal</a> no longer seems to attract comments, I finally performed a quick technical sanity check.  Looks like I've been posted 'comment disabled' entries on use.perl for some time.   My automatic cross-poster was feeding the wrong comment parameter to use.perl, and they were just getting turned off.
<p>
Hopefully that's now fixed, starting with this journal.
