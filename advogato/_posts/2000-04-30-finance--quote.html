<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Just received a letter informing me of a PHP version of
Finance::Quote's yahoo function that should be released in
the next couple of days.  This is great news, as I've had a
few requests for a PHP interface to Finance::Quote. I've
pointed the relevant people at each other and hopefully
they'll come to very happy arrangements.
<P>
I'm also thinking of writing a short guide on "How to submit
a patch for Finance::Quote", as it seems to be a
semi-regular requestion, and I most certainly do want the
patches.
<P>
I'm still going to try to release 0.18 today, although I'm
not certain of when I'll get the time to do it.

Jacinta's sister, Gwen, is moving in with us today.  She's
got herself a job in Melbourne and will be staying with us
for a while.  She's also applied for a job at Schoolsnet. 
Gwen's very nice, so I'm happy that she's moving in with us.
