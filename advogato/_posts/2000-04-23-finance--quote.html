<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Good hacking.  Added error-checking to all the
stock-fetching functions, stripped silly HTML from returns
by yahoo_europe, fixed a potential bug or two, and updated
all the regression tests.
<P>
Finance::Quote 0.18 is almost ready for release, although
the documentation could do with some re-working.  It'll be
good to get a more stable and reliable copy of the library
out there.
