<p><b>Diving</b><br />
Went diving before the <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">Open Source Developers' Conference</a>.  A little special, because this trip included my 100th dive.
<p>
<b>Open Source Developers' Conference 2007</b><br />
I feel that <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">OSDC</a> 2007 was the best OSDC I have ever been to.  There were three main contributors to this.  Firstly, it was in Brisbane, which is warm, sunny, and has great diving.  Secondly, my talk was given a very nice timeslot.  Thirdly, I had nothing at all to do with its organisation.  The conference just happened, and the other speakers were great.  Awesome!
<p>
My very nice timeslot was a keynote.  This is the first time I'd been invited to keynote at a conference, and was a huge and unexpected honour.  Indeed, I was given the <i>dinner keynote</i>, the only session one can be sure that almost everyone will attend, on account of there being both free food and alcohol.  The keynote went <i>extremely</i> well, I don't think I could have hoped for a better audience reaction.  Once again, a huge amount of thanks goes to Jacinta Richardson, who spent countless hours helping me prepare the slides, and listening to me rehearse again and again.
<p>
Julien Goodwin recorded the entire keynote, and while I don't yet have a copy yet, it's my sincere hope to get the recording published on-line.  Stay tuned for progress.
<p>
<b>Holiday in Middle Earth</b><br />
December is a quiet season for our business.  Lots of people take holidays, so courses are hard to schedule.  I think this is fantastic, because it means that I can take a break too!
<p>
That break has recently been filled with playing <a href="http://www.lotro.com/">Lord of the Rings Online</a>, which I noticed kept receiving good reviews, and deservedly so.  The game looks great, runs on older hardware, can be entirely downloaded and registered on-line, and has been a tremendous amount of fun.  I won't go into too much detail, but I can say that it's definitely worth having a play, and if you're a fan of Middle Earth you'll especially enjoy the sight-seeing.
<p>
On that note, I've been given the ability to hand out 10-day trials to the game.  These are both longer than the 7-day trials you can get on-line, come with cheaper pricing if you do choose to subscribe, and give me kickbacks of free game-time if you do.  Let me know if you'd like one, the only real condition is that you <i>have</i> to accept, since there's a limited number of unaccepted invites I can have floating around at any time.
