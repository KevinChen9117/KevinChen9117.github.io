<B>Work</b><BR>
Busy busy busy.  Off to Brisbane and back again, lots of time at Monash, and very little time in the office.  That means lots of stress.  I'm looking forward to when things quieten, but that probably won't be for another six weeks.
<p>
<b>Fruit</b><br>
Had my first taste of Durian today.  It was, well, very pungent, as Durian are apt to be.  Jacinta coped with hers better than I, and our rabbit Shadow didn't want any at all.  The whole place stinks now, no wonder you're not allowed to take them into hotels.
<p>
<b>Orkut</b><br>
Received an invitation to <a href="http://www.orkut.com/">orkut</a> the other day from Ian.  I was skeptical at first, and as many people have pointed out orkut have quite an EULA.  As such, I'm making sure I don't say, post or do anything on orkut that I want to retain any rights to.
<p>
Despite my skepticism, I've found orkut to be an enjoyable place, and I've even tracked down a few old friends from it.
<p>
The forums code really needs a re-write, though.  I haven't been able to find any way to 'watch' a thread.  Actually, threads would be nice, currently everything is just a linear topic.
<p>
The ability to post to everyone in a community is also rife for abuse.  I'm certain it won't be too long before we have spammers creating accounts, joining the big communties, and then sending out messages on their latest 'products'.
