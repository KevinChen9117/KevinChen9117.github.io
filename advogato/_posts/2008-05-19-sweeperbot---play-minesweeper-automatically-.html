<p><b>SweeperBot - Play MineSweeper Automatically!</b><br>
My latest project has finally been launched.  See <a href="http://sweeperbot.org/">SweeperBot.org</a> for the latest in Windows productivity software.  Even if you don't use Windows, do watch the 50 second video on the site; it represents a whole day of my life spent poorly, and I think it's hilarious. ;)
<p>
For anyone wondering, yes, it's written in Perl.  It uses PAR/PP to package the whole thing up into a single Windows executable.  Yes, it plays MineSweeper acceptably well, thanks to Audrey Tang showing me the cheat codes at OSDC a few years back. ;)
