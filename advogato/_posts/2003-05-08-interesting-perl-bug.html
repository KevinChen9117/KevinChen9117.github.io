<B>Interesting Perl Bug</b><BR>
To see an interesting bug which caused me many headaches, enter the following script, and mark it setuid.  Then run it as any other user except the owner.
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -wT
$ENV{PATH} = "";
print "Hello World\n";
system($0,"1") unless @ARGV;
</pre>
<p>
The result is a delightful message about how your kernel has a setuid script bug which is rather dangerous and easy to exploit... except that you don't
<p>
Perl is just getting confused because it looks like the interpretor has been started setuid before it's had a chance to do sanity checking and invoke suidperl.  The result is the inability to have a setuid script invoke itself.  Very bothersome.
<p>
The solution is to drop setuid privileges before the script calls itself again.  Conveniently enough, Perl allows us to localise <tt>$&gt;</tt> (effective UID), so the following program <i>does</i> work as intended:
<p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -wT
$ENV{PATH} = "";
print "Hello World\n";
unless (@ARGV) {local $&gt; = $&lt;; system($0,"1");}
</pre>
<p>
Because of the use of <tt>local</tt>, setuid privileges are only dropped for the duration of the call to <tt>system</tt>.  Of course, it's usually a good idea to drop setuid privileges as soon as possible, or only invoke them when you absolutely have to.
