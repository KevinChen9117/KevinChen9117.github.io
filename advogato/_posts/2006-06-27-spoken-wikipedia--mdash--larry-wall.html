<p><b>Spoken Wikipedia &mdash; Larry Wall</b><br />
Last night I discovered an old microphone, and today during my lunchbreak I thought I'd try my hand at <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Spoken_Wikipedia">Spoken Wikipedia</a>.
<p>
My ideal "first article" needed to be short, easy to read, and on a subject that I was interested in.  I considered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl">Perl</a>, but it's rather long, and reading programming examples can be challenging.  So I settled on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall">Larry Wall</a> instead (<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5c/Larry_Wall.ogg">audio</a>).
<p>
Apparently my Australian accent is rather pronounced, most notably the Australian tendency to drop vowels, syllables, and sometimes entire words when it suits them.  Still, it was a fun thing to do over a lunchtime, and I've now got some experience in sound editing.
