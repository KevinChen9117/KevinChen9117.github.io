<B>Smoking</b><BR>
I have an interesting dilemma at work.  Our new support
person, Kathryn, is an unsuccessful ex-smoker.  She gave up
for a while, but she's now buying and smoking cigarettes
again.  Since she wants to give up, I'd like to help Kathryn
beat her habit.  Unfortunately, it's hard to argue with
complete and utter unthinking physical addiction, and
nicotine addiction is about as strong as it gets.
<P>
I've never smoked, I've never had the desire, and I don't
intend to start.  I have had a family member die a painful
and protracted death from a smoking related illness, and I
don't think that experience is something I will ever
forget.  I can't think of very many worse ways to die.
<P>
I'm not an anti-smoking zealot, but if someone wants to give
up, then I'm seriously very happy to help them.  My dilemma
is that I don't know how.  I've tried taking Kathryn's
cigarettes, but she just buys more.  I've even offered to
trade her cigarettes for lollies and sugary things (Kathryn
has a sweet-tooth).  Alas, no luck so far.
