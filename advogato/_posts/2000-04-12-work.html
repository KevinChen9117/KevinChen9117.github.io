<B>Work</b><BR>
The bug is still dead.  Testing says it's dead.  Everybody's
happy.
<P>
Now that I've fixed a problem (with Dancer's help) on this
particular product, I've now been forwarded the other bugs
with it. I don't want the other bugs.  I don't know the
code.  I have other bugs outstanding in my main line of
work.  I've even gained a new nickname based upon a typo of
the product's name -- I'm now being called 'Lover Boy'.
<P>
People with competing bugs are trying to get me off the
project.  I hope they succeed.
