<I>Humpy (to Scott):</i>
Well, you tell me.  You're the one who's going
to be writing the crappy code.

One cannot live off wedding cake alone.  I tried that today,
and it didn't make me feel any better.

<B>Banks</b><BR>
Looks like the banks approve me in principal, but want the
paperwork and the actual house before signing on the line. 
This is pretty much what I expect, and that the banks tell
me that I'm "very comfortably within my limits" is
reassuring.

The Real Estate agents still need to send me a complete
Section 32, the one they gave me was missing the rates
notices.  Interesting that the notice of rates also usually
contains a valuation by the council.  I wonder if they're
trying to hide something?
