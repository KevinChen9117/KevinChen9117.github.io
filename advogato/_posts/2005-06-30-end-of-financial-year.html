<p><b>End of financial year</b><br/>
It's the end of financial year, and everyone and everything is just a little more hectic because of it.  I have a ton of deadlines: negotiations with our bank, taxation matters, a stupidly big pile of paperwork, and a number of conference and magazine-article related matters.
<p>
However my real task for the day is clearing my desk, and making sure that there isn't anything that we really want to take advantage of in the 2004-05 financial year.  Any spare time will be spent catching up on accounting and tax matters.
<p>
The good news is that despite the busy time was year, I was still able to go out to dinner last night with about a dozen very good friends, and I was still able to sleep until the gloriously late time of 10am.  One of the distinct advantages of running one's own business is flexibility of hours.
<p>
On the matter of running a business, I'll be presenting a short yet amusing talk on starting a business at the <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/osdclub/">Open Source Developers Club</a> on the 13th July, 2005.  This will be a sneak-preview of my paper and presentation for the <a href="http://www.sage-au.org.au/conf/sage-au2005/">Australian System Administrators Conference</a> in Perth later this year.
