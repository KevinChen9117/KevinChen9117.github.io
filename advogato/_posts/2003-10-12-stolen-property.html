<B>Stolen Property</b><BR>
The last time I remember somebody stealing from me would have been back when I was in primary school.  Sure, the odd friend may have loaned a book here and there which they forgot to return, but our house has never been burglarized, and I've never been involved in a mugging.
<p>
As such, it was to my great surprise to discover that theives have been at work on our property.  Our lovely silverbeet is almost entirely gone!  Someone's helped themselves to our front vegie patch, and taken the biggest and bestest of our silverbeet leaves.
<p>
If it were any other plant, I probably wouldn't have minded.  We've got plenty of lettuce, heaps of broad beans, lots of peas, and rhubarb everywhere.  But we only had one silverbeet plant, and it was only just reaching the stage where we were ready to pick a few leaves from it.  Now it will be a long time before we can safely harvest from it, as only a few leaves are left.

<B>Buck's Night</b><BR>
Some last-minute mix-ups resulted in us changing venue for the dinner, but the laser-games afterwards were very successsful and enjoyed by all.  Unfortunately my team got completely owned in the two team-games.  A big congrats up to both Jacinta and <a href="/person/scottp/">scottp</a> who did an excellent job at base-defense.
