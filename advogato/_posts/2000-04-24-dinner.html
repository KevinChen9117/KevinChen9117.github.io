<B>Dinner</b><BR>
<I>White Lotus</i> still have the yummiest food in
Melbourne.  Yum!
<P>
<B>Sleep</b><BR>
I remember being a young child and my bedtime rolling around
every night and me having to go to sleep otherwise I won't
wake up for school.  Now I'm an *ahem* older child, and I
still have to go to bed at 10:30 every night else I won't
wake up for work.  However right now I'm on holidays, and
like a kid with the parents away, I don't really want to go
to sleep.  I want to stay up and hack code and play loud
music and <A HREF=http://3k.org/>mud</a>.

<B>Rockclimbing</b><BR>
Didn't go rock-climbing today.  Benni was in Bendigo looking
at guitar porn with his girlfriend.
