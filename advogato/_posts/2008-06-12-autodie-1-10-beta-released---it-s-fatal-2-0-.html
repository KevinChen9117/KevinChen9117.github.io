<b>autodie 1.10 beta released - It's Fatal 2.0!</b><br>
After much hacking, I'm very glad to say that I've got a version of Fatal/autodie that I'm willing to foist upon the world for beta testing. It's not a release candidate, but all the important things that should work, do work (I hope).
<p>
For those who haven't seen my previous discussions, you can think of autodie as a Fatal 2.0.  It provides lexical scope, exception objects, and much nicer error messages.  It even lets you make system() fatal[1].
<p>
You can find the distribution at:
<blockquote>
    <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/~pjf/autodie/">http://perltraining.com.au/~pjf/autodie/</a>
</blockquote><p>
It's currently not on the CPAN because I don't want innocent bystanders replacing their Fatal.pm by accident.
<p>
Currently it only works on Perl 5.10 and above.  Support for 5.8 is on my <a href="http://github.com/pfenwick/autodie/tree/master/TODO ">TODO list</a>.
<p>
I'm specifically after feedback on the following points:
<ul>
<li>Do any tests fail on your system?
<li>If you use the new Fatal.pm module, does any of your existing code break?  (It should be 100% backwards compatible.)
<li>If you s/Fatal/autodie/; in your code, does it do what you expect?  Are the error messages nicer?  Are there any gotchas I've missed?
</ul><p>
If you really want to get your hands dirty, feel free to look at the <a href="http://github.com/pfenwick/autodie/tree/master/TODO">TODO file</a>, the <a href="http://github.com/pfenwick/autodie/tree/master/DESIGN.pod">DESIGN.pod</a> file, or the source code in general.  Suggestions and patches are very much appreciated.  If you've got a github account, I'm happy to give you commit access, or you can just fork the repository.
<p>
If you want to see my five minute talk about what this is about, see <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=540">the video in my blog</a>.

I also want to say a special thank-you to Aristotle, who has provided invaluable feedback while I've been working on the project.
<p>
Any questions, feedback, criticisms, patches, or ideas are welcome.

Many thanks,
