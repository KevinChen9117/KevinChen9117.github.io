<B>CVS</b><BR>
I'm always amazed in interviews when people tell me that in
their previous jobs they didn't use a revision control
system.  I can't imagine doing any sort of serious coding
without CVS.  If I were any better friends with CVS then I'd
probably be sleeping with it.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
Made a tiny branch for Finance::Quote 0.18, GnuCash
edition.  F::Q was originally part of GnuCash, and a few
months ago I
branched it off into its own development.  I still roll the
changes back into the GnuCash tree, but they require minor
changes here and there.  It's amazing how the words "feature
freeze" can get me to start hacking code again. :)
<P>
<B>Rockclimbing and Hackey-sack</b><BR>
Ian injured his arm playing hackey-sack.  I don't know how
that's possible, considering that you don't even use your
arms in hackey-sack, but Ian did it nonetheless.  As such,
he dropped out of climbing this week.  :(
<P>
<B>Perl</b><BR>
<I>Makes simple jobs easy, makes hard jobs possible</i>.  My
goodness, I really do love perl sometimes.  Just simple
things like being able to throw around references to
anonymous functions can really make a man's day.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Spent an entire day on things political.  I really didn't
join this company to spend my days arguing politics, I
actually joined it to code.  Unfortunately the culture,
values, and many other reasons why I joined have been
eroded.  Dan is coming back on Monday, and while I'm sure
he'll be able to fix some problems, he won't be able to fix
all of them.
<P>
I'm working on plans should the conditions at Schoolsnet
become unworkable, and how to try and stop the decline
before that happens.  I don't really want to leave -- I love
the people here and what's left of the culture, but at the
same time I don't want to be working for some corporate
juggernaut.
