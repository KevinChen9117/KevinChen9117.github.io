<B>No more flash ads!</b><BR>
I've loved <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> for its ability to disable pop-ups, block ads, and generally be incredibly useful.  However it's always bothered me that I can't block flash-ads in the same way that I can block normal images.
<p>
However, thanks to a helpful comment on <a href="http://slashdot.org/">slashdot</a> today, I discovered there is a way to block flash ads!  My web-browsing experience has now become a whole lot nicer.  For instructions, you can visit <a href="http://dion.swamp.dk/stuff.html">Dion's stuff</a>.
