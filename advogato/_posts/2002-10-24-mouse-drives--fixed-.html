<B>Mouse drives (fixed)</b><BR>
Of course!  Why didn't I think of it?  The trick was to power cycle the machine another couple of times after the "successful installation".

I'm so glad I usually work with an OS that doesn't require five reboots to install a new mouse (that uses the same mouse protocol as the old mouse).
