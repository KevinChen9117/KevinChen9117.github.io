<p><b>Spyware scare</b><br/>
Aside from all the regular tools that get run to protect Windows machines from malicious code, I also like to do a visual inspection of what processes are running.
<p>
Last night I had something of a fright when I found a process called <tt>PRONoMgr.exe</tt> running.  I thought that had to be something dodgy, and I was expecting an unhappy evening of machine sanitisation.
<p>
Turns out, the <tt>PRONoMgr.exe</tt> is the Intel <i>PRO</i> <i>N</i>etwork <i>o</i>bject <i>M</i>an<i>g</i>e<i>r</i>.  Despite sounding like something that would redirect your browser to an unsavoury destination, it actually looks after the wireless network card.  Thanks, Intel.
