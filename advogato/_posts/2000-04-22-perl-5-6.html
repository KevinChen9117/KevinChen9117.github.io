<B>Perl 5.6</b><BR>
Finally got around to reading about the <A
HREF=http://www.perl.com/pub/2000/04/whatsnew.html>new
features of perl 5.6</a>.  Being a bit of a perl nut, some
of the new features really tickled my fancy.
<P>
By far my favourite new feature is <A
HREF=http://www.perl.com/pub/2000/04/whatsnew.html#Weak_References>weak
references</a>, which looks like it might be an effective
asprin to memory-leak headaches.  (Use only as directed.  If
pain persists, please see your debugger.)
<P>
The new <A
HREF=http://www.perl.com/pub/2000/04/whatsnew.html#Miscellaneous_Bits>our</a>
syntax for global various is very cute, and I like it a
lot.  Using <A
HREF=http://www.perl.com/pub/2000/04/whatsnew.html#Lvaluable_Subroutines>
subroutines as lvalues</a> seems weird and bizzare,
incredibly powerful, and slightly dangerous.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote</b><BR>
<A HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/brentn>Brent</a> made
a number of excellent changes to Finance::Quote,
particularly in relation to his TIAA-CREF function, and has
even added regression testing checks for his changes.  I'm
now quite certain we're going to get along well as a
development team.  :)
