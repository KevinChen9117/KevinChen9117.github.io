<B>Lightning</b><BR>
You know when lightning is striking close to your house
because all your flouros light up followed by one almighty
BOOM.  I'm very sad that my UPS isn't arriving until Monday,
because I think it could be very handy right now.
<P>
<B>Other news</b><BR>
I've got some other news, but I'll be writing that in my
next entry.  If I tell everyone now it will spoil the surprise.
