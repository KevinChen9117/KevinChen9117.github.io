<B>Credit Report</b><BR>
Invoked the Privacy Act a couple of weeks ago and got a copy of my credit file.  The way some spammers push these services, you'd think your file would be filled with sordid details.  Instead, it was exceeding dull.  This is your name.  You've lived there, there, and here.  You last know about you working for a company that you left 2-3 years ago.  These businesses asked for your credit report on these dates, and that unsurprisingly corresponded with when I was evaluating loans to purchase a house.  No other details recorded.  <i>Yawn</i>

<B>Work</b><BR>
Busy busy busy.  Always busy.  Did an upgrade for a client today and one of the drives that arrived was DOA.  I hate hard-drives.

<B>Hard-drives</b><BR>
Big box of three hard-drives arrived from Seagate, as part of my previous warranty return.  The box contained an almost unbelievable amount of foam-rubber packing.
