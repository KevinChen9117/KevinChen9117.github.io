<b>Photos of The Damian</b><br/>
As part of our
<a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia's</a>
advertising campaign we're looking at adding pictures of our trainers
to both the website and a number of our advertising materials.  Since
we have a number of courses to be conducted by Dr Damian Conway early
next year (<a href="http://perltraining.com.au/bookings.html">bookings are
open</a>), Jacinta politely asked Damian for an appropriate photo.  To
quote from the e-mail that ensued:

<blockquote><p>
<i>Jacinta:</i> Interesting props in the background are up to you.<br/>
<i>Damian:</i> As you can see, I went for the grandest prop I could find. ;-)
</blockquote>
<p>
While I appreciate Damian's photo (shown on
<a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=335&amp;count=1">pjf.id.au</a>),
I'm not exactly sure if it's what we had in mind for our push to big
business.  However it definitely has appeal when dealing with local
Perl Mongers groups.

<b>Habits of Perlish People</b><br/>
I've discovered that <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>
is an excellent way to discover the interests of others.  For example,
looking at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&target=Dominus">the edits of MJD</a>
shows an interest in mathematics, octopodes, programming, and food.
Looking at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&target=RandalSchwartz">the edits of Randal</a>
reveals an interest in Perl, Hooters, and The Flintstones.

<b>Flags</b><br/>
Wrote a little on
<a href="http://hotornot.perltraining.com.au/flags/meet/UNKG001.html">The Union Jack</a> and the
<a href="http://hotornot.perltraining.com.au/flags/meet/SWIT005.html">Appenzell Canton</a>
both of which feature in the <a href="http://hotornot.perltraining.com.au/flags/hottest.html">hottest flags</a>
listing, showing that Internet users can have all the maturity of
Swiss heads of state.
