<B>Blooper of the Week</b><BR>
Every week at work during our Friday staff meeting we have
an agenda item titled "Blooper of the Week".  This item is
to acknowledge the most amusing blooper of that week, and
involves the handover of a large black dunce-hat.
<P>
The blooper this week must go to our CEO.  After finally
clinching a major deal, John spent five hours at the pub,
and proceeded to celebrate by throwing food from the 8th
floor balcony at passers-by.  Apparently he managed to hit
(or almost hit) a few of the cleaning staff, and the police
have been called by the car-park guard (who thinks there are
'kids on the roof causing trouble').
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
Ian was a real sweetie and brought me a large, shiny,
complex-looking bug, marked with "XXX".  Ian knows that 90%
of the bugs I have to chase have "XXX - May cause problems"
written in the code nearby the actual bug, and has decided
to celebrate this with me in his own special way.  I hope to
pass the bug on when somebody else becomes bug-boy.
