<B>TPJ</b><BR>
Told Jon I'd try to get a rough draft out this week.  Must
drag myself away from X-COM long enough to finish it.

and Justin have introduced me to the joys of X-COM
Apocolypse.  I'm a bit of a closet turn-based
tactical/strategy junkie (I <I>loved</i> board games like
Diplomacy and Space-Hulk), and X-COM III has really tickled
my fancy.

Dan's been making me very happy by encouraging me to
bullet-proof and harden some of our older and more critical
software.  Good Dan.  :)

There's also been a bit of a restructure in the dev team. 
I'm interested to see how it turns out.
