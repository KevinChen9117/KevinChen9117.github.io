<p><b>Wetsuits</b><br/>
The business that shipped me the wrong wetsuit have been very polite and up-front about their mistake, and are very willing to fix it.  I can keep my existing suit for a partial refund (tempting, since it's a really comfortable suit, and I want to go diving next weekend), or I can return it at their expense for a replacement, which unfortunately will take 2-3 weeks to arrive.
<p>
I'm choosing to return the suit, as it means I won't need to worry about finding a buyer for the old suit, and I also get relief from import duties as the second suit will be a replacement, not a new import.
<p>
In the meantime it looks like I'll be wrestling my way into tight and rigid hire suits, while Jacinta lounges around in her custom-fitted semi-dry.
