<p><b>Conference Talks</b><br/>
Received a phone-call the other day regarding the upcoming SAGE-AU conference.  Would I like to give a second presentation in the technical program?
<p>
Calls like this always amuse me.  Asking if I'd like to stand in front of an audience and talk is like asking most people if they'd like a hundred dollars.
<p>
As such, I'm now presenting an additional talk.  The topic? "Conference Presentation 101".  It will show heavily influences from MJD's presentation a few years back, a few tricks that I picked up along the way, and a good dose of bizzare science.
<p><b>Paperwork Day</b><br/>
I've been travelling around having a wonderful time teaching.  I'm now back in the office and working through everything that has landed on my desk while I've been out.  Yes, it's paperwork day.
<p>
None of the paperwork is very hard, it's just time consuming.  I've had to complete workcover forms, business activity statements, group certificates and payment declarations, dividend and franking accounts, insurance, tax, refunds, and goodness knows how many bills and invoices.  Still to come are income tax (two individual, one company) and a few end-of-year adjustments.  Bah.
<p>
It would be reasonably accurate to say that I've spent this week (and will be spending some of next week) working for the tax department.  This does have some advantages, most of our personal income and cash-flow have already been mapped out for the next 12 months.
