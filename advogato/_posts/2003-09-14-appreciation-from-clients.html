<B>Appreciation from clients</b><BR>
I had the entire support team from one of my clients spend considerable time telling me how much they appreciated my work, and how it would save them incredible amounts of pain and end-user headaches.  I was honoured, and quite speechless.
<p>
<B>David's leaving</b><BR>
One of my very good friends is joining the Army, and is likely to be posted to some far-away place by the end of this week.  He'll be sorely missed, although we all hope that he'll be able to make it back for the wedding, as he has a spot on the bridal party to fill.
<P>
<B>Cheesy Dance games and mats</b><BR>
We're now the proud owners of two cheap playstation dance mats.  They're just like regular controllers, only rolled out into large plastic sheets you can dance around on, and with all the controls in different locations.  Getting the mats was easy, they'll available everywhere, although prices seem to range from AUD $30 to AUD $300, depending upon quality and construction.
<p>
We thought it would be easy to pick up a cheesy game like <a href="http://gamenation.com.au/product/?action=view&id=941">Dance Stage Konamix</a>, which is designed to work really well with the mats.  In fact, it's proving to be an extremely difficult task.  The only place I can find that seems to have it has a broken registration process, broken ordering form, broken e-mail, and no contact details.  Despite that, the site appears to be regularly updated and maintained.  I figure that nobody's been able to actually contact them to tell them what's broken.
<p>
We ended up playing Gran Turismo and Pocket Fighter on the mats, both of which were interesting experiences.  We also played a little Bust'a'groove, which is definitely <i>not</i> designed to be played on a mat.  Hopefully we'll have the appropriate game(s) by the end of this week, before David dissapears.
