<B>Buffy</b><BR>
I just want them all to be happy.  Why can't everyone in Buffy be happy, like in the good old days?  Some big baddy would rock up, Giles would read some books, Willow would cast some spells, Xander would make some smart-arse remarks and then Buffy would kick its butt, and they'd all go to the Bronze and drink beer and live happily ever after.  Why do they all have to be so sad and emotional now?

I think I'm getting too involved with my Buffy watching.  On the up-side, Willow is looking really cute again.
