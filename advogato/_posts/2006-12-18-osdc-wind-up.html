<p><b>OSDC Wind-up</b><br />
It's been a week since OSDC finished, so I thought it best I tie up a few loose ends.  On Sunday Jacinta and I took Randal and Cog to the <a href="http://www.melbourneaquarium.com.au/">Melbourne Aquarium</a>.  This was very well received; it seems that our unique aquatic life are just as interesting as our land species.
<p>
In addition to the aquarium, books were autographed, gifts exchanged, drinks consumed, and stories were told.  Unfortunately were weren't able to find any pajamas with kangraroos on them; cog was looking for them "for a friend". ;)
<p>
Thanks to Jacinta's hard work, a <a href="http://perl.net.au/wiki/Open_Source_Developers_Conference_2006">summary of the conference</a>, including a <a href="http://perl.net.au/wiki/Open_Source_Developers_Conference_2006#Blogs">list of blogs</a> is on <a href="http://perl.net.au/">PerlNet</a>.  Please feel free to add to the list, you don't need an account to make changes.
