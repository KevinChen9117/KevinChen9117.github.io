<p><b>Magic &mdash; the reunion</b><br/>
What do you do when a bunch of friends from University haven't seen each other in a couple of weeks, and happen to all have a free weekend?  Why, you reach into the dusty attics, pull out long-forgotten boxes of cards, and mumble something about how we foolishly traded away our mox gems in our youth.
<p>
Yes, we had a day of getting together and playing <i>Magic &mdash; The Gathering</i>, what was commonly known as 'cardboard crack' back in my University days.  We even chuckled and laughed at the 'new' cards that one of our players had brought along, until we realised that those new cards were printed seven years ago.  Then we all felt just a little bit older.
<p>
The day was lots of fun, although being the first time many of us had played in almost a decade, there was considerable time spent reorganising decks.  We never ended up having a five-player prismatic game in the end, but that provides us with a good excuse to get together next time.
