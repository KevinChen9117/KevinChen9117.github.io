<B>Dance Games</b><BR>
Managed to find an on-line retailer with clues and a copy of the required game.  Hurrah.
<p>
<B>Accountancy</b><BR>
We seem to be missing a statement from the bank.  Either we received it and it's been mis-filed, it was never sent in the first place, or it was lost/stolen in transit.  Given that Jacinta and myself keep separate copies of this particular bank's statements, it looks like it's lost.  That worries me, but given that I've seen our post arrive in the entirely wrong suburb before, or us receive mail for occupants in a different house in a different street, it's not entirely surprising.
<p>
It is, however, incredibly bothersome.  I can't reconcile that account until the missing statement arrives.

<B>Employees</b><BR>
Lizy has started working with <a href="http://perltraining.com.au">Perl Training Australia</a>.  So far she's shown herself to be extremely organised, skilled, and is showing plenty of initiative.  The only problem is that I only have her on a part-time basis.
<p>
<B>Tax</b><BR>
Yup, I need to complete my tax.  Even with highly detailed financial records it's still a complete bore.
<p>
<B>Wedding</b><BR>
Is happening very soon now.  Organisation is huge.  I'm surprised the wedding industry does't put together package deals.  Buy a reception for 100 people, honeymoon to one of these destinations, photos, flowers, wedding location, cars,  invitations, celebrant, gift registry, dresses and suits, and a pair of fashionable wedding rings for only $xx,xxx.  Finance to approved customers, early-bird discounts available, conditions apply.
<P>
I guess everyone wants their wedding to be unique and special, or maybe I'm just missing something.
