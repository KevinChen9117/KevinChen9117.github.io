<B>Fun, excitement, adventure!</b><BR>
Yes, I'm finally doing my tax.  I get to fill out the main section, a supplimentary section, and a supplimental to the supplimentary section.  Oh yes, I also get a number of tax rulings to peruse on various topics.  Hurrah.
<P>
Despite this, the whole thing looks surprisingly straightforward, probably because I have GnuCash measuring all the relevant details and I just need to copy out the totals of the various ledgers.
<p>
From my current estimates, I'll get a return of about $500.  No big deal there, except that it means that I've overpaid my tax <i>again</i>.  This is a good thing, because it means the tax office judges me a responsible taxpayer, and consequently they're fine with me paying tax when I see fit, rather than having to pay a portion on my income every quarter; provided that the tax gets paid, of course.
<p>
The end result of this is that I get to keep the rather sizeable sum that would normally go to the tax department, and float it in an account instead where it can earn interest.  Then at the end of the financial year, I give the tax office, and pay extra tax on the interest from the float.  Good for me, good for the tax office.

Insane.  Not only are work and the wedding competing for time, but we're trying to move the business into a stage where it can be managed by others while Jacinta and myself are absent on honeymoon.  Ian's agreed to cover most of the fire-fighting and sysadmin side of things, and Lizy will be handling course bookings and administration.

<B>Perl</b><BR>
Perl 5.8.1 has just been released.  This is actually a special release for me, since there's a little bit of me in the newer NEXT module that comes with it.
