<p><b>LCA2006 - Norovirus</b><br />
Linux.conf.au 2006 has ended, and I will be saying a few more words on it shortly.  My report is somewhat delayed as myself and many other delegates contracted what is believed to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norovirus">Norovirus</a>. In my case this manifested itself with violent signs of gastrointestinal upset.
<p>
Luckily I seem to have completed my recovery in a mere 36 hours, but at least one delegate was hospitalised (now recovering nicely, thank-goodness). I also know that some unfortunates developed symptoms while on the plane; it's hard to imagine a more uncomfortable experience.
