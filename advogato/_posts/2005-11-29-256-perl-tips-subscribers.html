<p><b>256 Perl-tips subscribers</b><br />
Our <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/tips/">Perl Tips</a> newsletter has been running for almost a year now, and during that time we've posted slightly more frequently than one tip per fortnight.  While the newsletter's first birthday is rapidly approaching, we've also hit another important milestone, with 256 subscribers on the list.  I finally have an excuse to upgrade to a 16-bit architecture.
<p>
The most encouraging part of writing regular Perl tips is the feedback that we've received.  We know that our tips are regularly forwarded around a number of organisations, and we're always seeing new subscribers who have happened upon our <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/tips/">archive</a> and then decided to <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/perl-tips">subscribe</a> to the regular newsletter.
<p>
Planned improvements to the tips includes sorting the archive into categories.  When we only had a few tips, a chronological ordering is fine.  Now that we have lots of tips, a more categorised approach rapidly becoming appropriate.
