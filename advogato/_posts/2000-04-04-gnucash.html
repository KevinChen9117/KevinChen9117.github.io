<B>GnuCash</b><BR>
Hah!  It's easy to make money from Open Source.  With the
help of GnuCash I've discovered better decisions I can make
with some tricky financial choices that are just around the
bend.  This will save me quite a bit of money.

is now available on Sourceforge.  Hooray.  The code in the
CVS tree works pretty well, and I hope to have a proper
packagey thing out shortly for CPAN...  When I'm feeling
better.

<B>Work</b><BR>
Went to work today because I'm feeling much much better than
I was over the weekend.  Many people used colourful
expressions to describe
how I looked, and a number have encouraged me to go home
early and get some rest.  That sounds like a pretty good
idea.

Ian's at work now, with new cute little glasses. 
Unfortunately I wasn't feeling well enough to give him a
proper welcome to the company (nerf guns, whipped cream and
bondage), so he's managed to escape his first few days here
with some scraps of dignity.  I'm sure I'll be able to fix
that in time.
