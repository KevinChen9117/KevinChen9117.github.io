<p><b>Video: autodie - a lexical Fatal for Perl 5.10</b><br>
<i>Today's blog post is an adaption of a mail I just sent to perl5-porters.  If you're curious about what this <tt>autodie</tt> business is that I've been talking about, here's your chance to find out.  If you're reading this on my <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=540">main blog</a> you can just hit play on the widget below.

Some time ago, I started discussing the idea of autodie (previously codenamed 'lethal'), a lexical version of Fatal that could be implemented now that Perl 5.10's %^H hash does wonderful things.
<p>
Despite a small period where I was distracted by other things, I'm back to working on autodie, as I'm quite eager to get it released.  To help facilitate that, I've done a couple of things:

<ul>
<li><p>I've put my working repository on-line at:
<p>
    <a href="http://github.com/pfenwick/autodie/tree/master">http://github.com/pfenwick/autodie/tree/master</a>
<p>
  Feel free to clone it, play with it, and especially ask questions or make
  patches.  If you have a github account, and want commit access, ask.


<li><p>I've put my 5 minute talk about autodie on my blog at:
<p>
    <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=540">http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=540</a>
<p>
  It's just like watching me talk at a Perl Mongers meeting, but the guy in
  the second row can't heckle all the way through.

</ul>
<p>
The code at the moment should be considered a "work in progress", meaning it's ugly, filled with XXX and TODO's, is missing documentation, and contains undead horrors from Fatal's code generation routines.  Patches, questions, or just general encouragement welcome.  ;)
<p>
The on-line video contains a few things which aren't there quite yet, most notably:
<ul>
<li>We don't have 5.10.1, nor has autodie been released with it,
      but I hope you'll all think it's a good enough idea that it
      will be.  (It will also upgrade Fatal to have better error
      messages and a proper exception hierarchy).

<li>It's not yet on CPAN.  Since the autodie repository includes
      (a very modified) Fatal.pm, I don't want to upload non-production
      ready code that someone may install by accident.

</ul>

<p>
Feedback, questions, and patches of any sort is most welcome.  If you're not sure of my e-mail, I'm <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~pjf/">PJF on CPAN</a>.
