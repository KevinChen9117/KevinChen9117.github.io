<b>Puzzle Pirates</b><br />
Shiver me timbers!  <a href="http://www.puzzlepirates.com/">Puzzle Pirates</a> is a fine time-waster for an old salt like myself, and what better excuse to talk like a pirate to ye friends?  My pirate is <i>Tarrlox</i> on the sage ocean.  Feel free to drop me a message if you're also playing.
