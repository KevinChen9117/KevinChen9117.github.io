<B>Tip of the day</b><BR>
Don't say "good luck" to the nurse who's about to stick an inch long needle into your vein, as she might just break into laughter and miss.

I really should donate blood more often.  I always end up having a great time whenever I go.  Today I discovered that I both lost weight and hit an all-time-high with my haemoglobin levels.  In addition I discovered that lots of nurses really admire long hair, and that if you turn white and feel dizzy after refreshments you'll get the free wheelchair ride, even if you don't have a workmate around to broadcast your onsetting faintness.
