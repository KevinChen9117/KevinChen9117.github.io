<B>Weekend</b><BR>
Gwen's left back for Ballarat, and shall not be returning. 
She's going to be spending a bit of time there before
heading off to Perth.
<P>
Replaced ai-chan's hard-drive with one that doesn't make
noises like it's about to fall apart.  The old drive is due
to be placed in the proxy box to relieve the growing
shortage of space there.
<P>
Spent lots of time fiddling with hardware.  I normally play
X-COM on Gwen's machine, but since she's taken it with I've
had to re-install Windows on ai-chan.  I've never actually
noticed that my (fairly cheap) monitor has lost so much
brightness over the years until now.  At least it doesn't
lose colours like Gwen's one did.
<P>
Windows did something to my SCSI card so that it can no
longer be used under Linux.  I wish I knew what, I miss my
SCSI CD-ROM.

No time for open-source this weekend, unfortunately.  Going
to have to see if I can squeeze it into a weeknight
somewhere.

Biscuit has a flat tyre.  Must fix.

If at first it looks like it's broken, make sure you have
the correct version checked out of the repository.  It saves
lots of time bug-hunting.
