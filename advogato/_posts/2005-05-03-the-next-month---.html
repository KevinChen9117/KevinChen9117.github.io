<p><b>The next month...</b><br/>
My plans for almost every weekday in May look something like this:

<ul>
<li>Wake up.
<li>Travel to client (either training or consulting).
<li>Spend day on-site with client.
<li>Travel to lodgings (home or hotel)
<li>Have light meal.
<li>Catch up and execute fire-fighting tasks that have accumulated throughout the day, as we're currently short-staffed.
<li>Sleep.
</ul>
<p>
While this has the advantage that I'm deriving income from practically every waking moment, it doesn't provide me with a great deal of time for relaxation.  I really like relaxation, it's why I started the whole business in the first place.
<p>
The good news is that this is probably going to be the most hectic period for quite some time, so I can look forward to a quieter June/July.  In October, I even plan to have a holiday.
