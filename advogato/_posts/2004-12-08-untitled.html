It's been one year since <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=256&count=1">Mom unexpectedly passed away</a>, and as such this has been a time of reflection and rememberance for me.  It seems so very long ago, and yet it feels like just the other day when Mom was regularly calling with questions about her website, or dropping around with huge boxes of food in case my diet had dwindled to nothing more than espresso coffee and wasabi-coated roasted peas.  Now Dad drops around with huge boxes of food instead.  I have such wonderful parents.
<p>
I also have wonderful friends and family.  Ever since Mom's passing I know that both myself and my father have been amazed and sometimes overwhelmed by the generosity and caring of others.  I know that Dad's had some exhausting days where endless streams of visitors have dropped in to check on him, and bring him huge boxes of food lest his diet dwindle to nothing more than Irish breakfast tea and oranges.  Maybe that's why I keep getting these boxes of food from Dad.
<p>
On the anniversary of Mom's passing Dad, Jacinta and myself visited the crematorium and Mom's grave.  The plaque is still looking pretty good, but it's sobering to see how many friends and family members lie at rest there.

As for Mom's website, the content still remains in original condition at <a href="http://gcs.pjf.id.au/">gcs.pjf.id.au</a>.
