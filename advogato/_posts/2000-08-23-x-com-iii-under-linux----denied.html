<B>X-COM III under Linux -- denied</b><BR>
Playing with vmware. Got Win98 running using it, with
sound.  Installed X-COM Apocalypse.  X-COM will start and
show the intro video and sound.  Wow, thinks me, this is
cool.  I can play X-COM and use Linux at the same time.
<P>
Nope.  I get a message that the SVGA card isn't responding
or is not there, and the game halts.  This sucks.  So close
yet so far.
<P>
If vmware can get both X-COM apocalypse and Transport Tycoon
Deluxe to run in its virtual machine, I'll be most happy to
buy a copy.  Alas, this is not currently the case.  :(
