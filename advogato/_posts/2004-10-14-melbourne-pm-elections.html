<p><b>Melbourne.PM elections</b><br/>
Last night Melbourne.PM held its first AGM, a required step in becoming
a registered association.  A motley crew of members were elected into
the committee, and <a href="http://pjf.id.au/perl/melb.pm/">their picture
taken</a>.

<b>Journal</b><br/>
In addition to the regular outlets (use.perl and advogato), my
journal now appears on <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/">pjf.id.au</a>
as well.  This is important for my non-geek friends, who complain
about my journal being hidden on strange websites that have camel
fascinations.
