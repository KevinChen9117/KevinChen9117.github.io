<B>Health</b><BR>
Recovering from a mild bout of the common cold.  Stuffy nose, but not much else.  Real bummer getting it just before my big teaching run for the quarter, but I'm glad it's nothing more serious.
<p>
<B>Speeding</b><BR>
We have a large number of speeding cars in the street outside our house.  It's pegged as a 50km/hr zone, but plenty of people ignore that.  The local area has a large hoon population, with souped-up cars, doughnuts, and drag-races a common site.  While I chuckle at this most of the time, and admit that it's probably a symptom of deeper community issues, I have to admit that speeding cars isn't making the street a safer place to live.
<p>
A recent report in the local newspaper talks about how when the police do a blitz on traffic offenses, they end up booking an incredible number of drivers.  At the moment they're particularly targetting the speeding problem.  Now, this sounds like a great money-making enterprise for the police, except they're a community service and have other things to do than sit by the side of a road with a speed camera.
<p>
And so it dawned on me.  The police should sub-contract.  If I can easily spot a dozen cars going 20-30km/hr over the speed limit per day, then so can most people on the street.  Arrange for a training and qualification program for civilians to operate speed-cameras, and arrange for them to get a decent slice of any fines issued from cars they've caught.  Before you know it, you'll have a bunch of enterprising people doing their qualifications and operating speed-cameras from their front-yards.  Speeding is going to become very expensive.  Those streets which are considered particularly probelmatic will probably have citizens jostling for the right to operate a camera.
<p>
Of course, you'll probably see a higher incidence of road-rage as irate drivers take out their frustration on the newly empowered citizens.  That's a bit of a bummer.

<B>Returning Friends</b><BR>
David, who's gone and joined the army, will be visiting this weekend.  I won't get to spend as much time with him as I'd like, since I'm leaving interstate on Sunday on a teaching assignment.
<p>
We've organised for the next <a href="http://toee.perltraining.com.au/pub/">ToEE</a> game to run to co-incide with David's visit.  Apparently joining the army and being posted interstate isn't an excuse to miss roleplaying sessions.  ;)
