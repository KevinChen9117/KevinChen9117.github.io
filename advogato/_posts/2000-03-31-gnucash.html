My patches have integrated into GnuCash fine.  Tested them
and they all look good.

Scott's on leave and Dan managed to escape my wrath by being
interstate for the day.  The side-effect of this is that I'm
probably going to become Mr. Fix-it for a number of tasks
which Dan/Scott would normally deflect/ignore/absorb.  It's
been a quiet day so far, but I'm sure it's not going to stay
that way.

Planning on looking at houses this weekend.  I'd like a
place where I can run chickens.
