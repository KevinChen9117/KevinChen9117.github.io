<B>Tragedy</b><BR>
My mother was a regular reader of this journal.  Not very long after each post she'd usually contact me with advice, questions, or to tell me that I've made errors. In many cases these 'errors' were just industry puns.
<p>
Unfortunately, my mother won't be calling me about this entry.
<p>
Yesterday, Frances Fenwick, my beloved mother, unexpectedly passed away.
<p>
Mom was going to pick us up for tea. We were to go to her house and help set up a new scanner, something she was looking forward to immensely.  However, she never arrived, and never returned our calls.
<p>
We're not quite sure what happened, and mom is currently with the coroner.  We think that it could have been asthma related, but it may have been a heart problem, or it could be something else entirely.  At the moment we just don't know.
<p>
My father found mom on the kitchen floor when he returned from work Sunday afternoon.  He attempted CPR, but by the time mom was found, it was too late.
<p>
My mother was in poor health for some years, but that never prevented her from getting about and doing what she wanted.  Although she was unwell, none of us expected anything like this to happen.  It's been a shock to myself, my father, and our family and friends.
<p>
The main project that my mother was working on was the <a href="http://www.georgecollingridgesociety.org/">George Collingridge Society website</a>.  My mother was passionate and inspired by her research, and I believe that she would have liked us to view her pages, even though they were not yet complete.
<p>
My mother will be sorely missed, and fondly remembered.
