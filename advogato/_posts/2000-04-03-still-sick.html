<B>Still Sick</b><BR>
I still have a snuffly nose which I hope will be better in
the morning.  I'd hate for me to miss our regular Sunday
rockclimbing and mexican feast due to some silly sickness.

<B>GnuCash</b><BR>
Spent a good part of the evening confessing to GnuCash all
my dark financial secrets.  I now know how much I own (a
bit), how much I owe (a bit), and how much that all works
out to be (a little bit).  For some reason this makes me
feel good, as I didn't really know all this before.

<B>Hardware</b><BR>
My webserver is emitting a funny `burning-plastic' kind of
smell, possibly because it's been covered with programming
references, newspapers, and old financial statements.  I've
unearthed the webserver to give it a bit more room to
breathe.  Since my nose is blocked I can't really mind the
smell.
