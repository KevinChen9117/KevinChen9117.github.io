<B>Dinner</b><BR>
Went to dinner with my parents last night at a nearby
Turkish resturant.  I've been to this resturant many times
before and enjoyed both their food and service, but last
thing things were oddly different.
<P>
Upon entering the resturant, a bearded man, in his 40s or
50s, approached me.  "<I>Excuse me, but are you Mozart?</i>"
he queried with a rich European accent.  The man took it
well when I confessed that I was not Mozart, and he went
back to ordering from the take-away bar.  It never occured
to me before that I may look like a great composer, although
my uncle has been asked many times if he was John Lennon.
<P>
My parents, Jacinta, and myself sat at a table in the
corner.  We talked a little about the menu when I heard
someone calling my name.  "<I>Excuse me?  Paul?</i>"  An old
collegue of mine from my Computer Science days was sitting
on the table next to me.  "<I>Didn't you just submit a
couple of patches to GnuCash?</i>"  Oh dear, my toying with
accounting programs is starting to have influences on the
real world.  Should I be worried?
