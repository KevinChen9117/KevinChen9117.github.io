<B>Advogato</b><BR>
Well, I've gone from Apprentice, down to Observer, and now
I'm up to Journeyer.  At least I can post comments now, and
that makes me happy.  Thanks to everyone who's been taking
the time to certify me.
<P>
<B>Rockclimbing</b><BR>
Went rockclimbing today with Ian, Ben and Daniel.  It's good
to be well enough to go climbing again, as I haven't been
for some time.  I climbed a few new walls until my tummy
started hurting whenever I used upper-body strength.  I hope
this isn't the first sign of a herina (spel?).
<P>
Sofie (Ian's SO) has had her operation and is now allowed to
drink alochol again.  She's planning on getting pished next
week.  It should be fun.  She has a little jar of what the
doctors pulled from her when she was under the knife.  The
results look like little green teeth.  I'm sure this will be
a great conversation piece for her in the years to come.
<P>
We had mexican afterwards (the traditional food of
rockclimbers everywhere), and I brought some back for
Jacinta, who's caught my cold.  She seems a lot better now,
although I worry that she's read too many Larry Wall quotes
for her own good.
<P>
<B>Work</b><BR>
None, because it's been a weekend.  However, my work account
does get my e-mail, and I don't seem to have been getting
many recently in my mailbox.  I <I>have</i> been getting
errors from fetchmail about POP3 failing.  I'm not happy. 
My outgoing e-mail seems to be fine.
<P>
<B>Finance::Quote/GnuCash</b><BR>
<A HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/brentn>Brent</a>'s
patch for Finance::Quote has found it's way into GnuCash.  I
should probably e-mail him and let him know.
<P>
<A HREF=http://www.advogato.net/person/mojotoad>Mojotoad</a>
has also released a perl module to fetch historical quotes
and looks like he's thinking of adding it to GnuCash.  This
is a <I>Good Thing</i>.
<P>
Played with <I>PAUSE</i> (Perl Author's Upload Server) a
little, although I'm still not used to it yet.  I'm sure
I'll manuver Finance::Quote onto CPAN soon.  :)
