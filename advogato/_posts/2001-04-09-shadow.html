<B>Shadow</b><BR>
Last night Shadow discovered that he could climb over the
carefully constructed barriers to prevent him from getting
behind/underneath the fridge, and so we went a lot of time
looking for him this morning before realising he was back in
his old haunt.  To make matters more fun, he also took a
bite out of yet <I>another</i> phone cord.  Luckily this
bite only took off some of the insulation.  It seems that
phone-cords are thin and flat and hence the same shape as
nice fat grass.  Thank-goodness he's ignored power cords and
CAT5.
<P>
Shadow's become a lot more confident and happy, and does
less running away and more cute little grunting noises to
signal his dissaproval.  Whilst I appreciate his
considerance in pooping behind the toilet door, I really
wish that he'd use his litter tray for that sort of thing.
<P>
Shadow likes dandelion flowers.  So do I, so once again
we're competing for the same foods in the back-yard. 
Luckily there's enough to go around.

<B>Games</b><BR>
Grabbed myself a copy of the much awaited <I>Black &amp;
White</i>, and spent the weekend playing it.  It's visually
very impressive, quite amusing, and the gesture interface is
something very new and very good.  I do feel that the
gesture interface would be more natural with a dataglove,
but it's certainly very refreshing not to be clicking on
endless sets of icons. In fact, the game doesn't really have
icons.
