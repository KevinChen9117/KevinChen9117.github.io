<B>Work</b><BR>
A Friday.  I figured everything would be pretty good.  Have
the morning meeting, drink a coffee, kick-back and leisurely
iron out a few stray bugs here and there.  Not the case.
<P>
This morning Dan called me in the middle of breakfast.  Told
me there was a problem.  Told me that bad things were
happening.  I told him that I'd be there shortly.
<P>
Cycled in, figured out the most likely cause of the problem
on the way in.  Came into work and discussed bugs with all. 
I suggested that one of the auxillary libraries which fixed
many of the bugs hadn't been upgraded.  We checked.  It had
been.  However, the main program itself wasn't upgraded to
the bugfixed version.  That would explain everything.
<P>
Made sure that all was upgraded properly, went to the
morning meeting, drank my coffee, kicked-back for some
bug-hunting and got emergency sticky-noted by Dan again. 
Apparently the bugs were back, and 10 times worse.
<P>
Went to lunch (being pretty hungry after being called away
from breakfast), came back, looked at errors.  No, there
were not 600 errors, there were only 8.  There were 592
instances of the server having a high-load and asking
clients to retry later.
<P>
Scott told Dan the good news (the mountain becomes a
molehill), and Dan looks like he's about to kiss one of us. 
I like Dan, but not that much.  Besides, he's getting
married in a couple of weeks.
<P>
Get back to my office, relax, tracked down the bug that was
causing the last 8 errors.  The bug was where we thought it
was all along, except that we'd always find other, bigger
bugs when we were looking for it.  This should be the final
battle of me verus The Obscure Bug, and with luck I should
win.
<P>
To make the day even more weird, Dan and the Systems team
have all gone off on `SysTrek' to discuss `Systems
Matters'.  This has pretty much killed our targets for
Half-Life tonight.
<P>
Rumour has it that performance reviews will be finished on
Monday.  I don't believe that will happen, but if they
aren't finished by next week we'll have to cancel Dan's
wedding.
<P>

Someone's grabbed it and worked on it and will be sending me
a patch shortly.  Mmmm....  Rapid development...

After re-reading the Advogato ratings I've re-certified
myself up to Journeyer.  Personally I feel I'm about
half-way between the levels at the moment, but as yet we
don't have a rating for that.  Mind you, the Meta article
seems to be suggesting we might have one soon.
