<p><b>Wikipedia on wild edible plants</b><br/>
Wikipedia is an excellent resource, but seems to perform poorly in the field of wild edible plants.  I'm slowly correcting that, with today's entry being a short article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sowthistle">sowthistles</a>.  For such a common plant I'm surprised that there was no article already.
<p>
As usual, I need a better photo.  All the sowthistles of reasonable size in our garden tend to get eaten.
