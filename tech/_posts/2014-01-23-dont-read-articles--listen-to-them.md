This morning I pottered around the kitchen. I made toast and coffee, I washed
the dishes, I sorted my groceries. I also read a lengthy article on AIDS in
China at the same time.  In fact, I've been reading more than ever now that
I've given up on actually *reading*.

I don't hide the fact that I want to learn everything. I have
[flashcards][anki] that I practice every day, I'm enrolled in more
[coursera][coursera] courses than I can poke a stick at, and my most favourite
thing in the world is to find someone with specialised knowledge and
enthusiasm and talk to them about it in depth. Consequently, I do a lot of
thinking about how to learn efficiently.

One thing which is very apparent to me is that I have limited resources when
it comes to concentration. If I'm having a conversation, or writing an
article, or hacking code, then that concentration slot is full; I can't do
anything else that requires much cognition at the same time. It's concentration
that's my limited resource when it comes to learning and creating.

And yet, there are so many times each day when I'm *not* concentrating on
something, and yet have the capacity to do so. Public transport, making
breakfast, even sitting on the loo. Sometimes those times are used for serious
thinking, but often they're just filled with frivolous or even anxious
thoughts.

I have a good solution to this. And for me, it's been game-changing.

There's a free app called [Pocket][pocket]. It takes articles, turns them into
a format that looks great on mobile devices, and syncs them so you can read
them anywhere. That's nice; but by itself it still means I need to have my
phone out to read.

The clincher is that Pocket for Android comes with built-in text-to-speech
(TTS) capabilities. If you combine it with a TTS engine that doesn't
suck, and [Ivona][ivona] immediately springs to mind here, then you have a
*much* easier way of "reading" articles.

The combination is so nice that I read articles almost exclusively via Pocket
and Ivona now. I'm even adding [exobrain][exobrain] capabilities sending me an
article on social media will automatically add it to my reading queues. Of
course, all my writing on [pjf.id.au][pjf] sounds great in Pocket, too!

Alas, Pocket for iOS lacks the built-in TTS capabilities; I've been told
iOS lacks an easy-to-use speech interface for developers. However many
third-party apps seem to have sprung up to fill this niche. If you have any
good experiences, I'd love to hear about them.
