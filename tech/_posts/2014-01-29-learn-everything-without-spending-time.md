What if I told you there's an app which runs on all your devices, is
free, has strong evidence-based support for its effectiveness, and
allows you to acquire large amounts of knowledge and
*retain it indefinitely*?

What if I told you it wasn't even going to take any time out of your
day?

There are two amazing tools which I use during those odd chunks of time.
The first [reads me articles I've saved][pjf-pocket], and requires
only that I have headphones. The second is
[Anki][anki], and it's like having cheat-codes for knowledge.

Anki is a flash-card system that employs
[spaced repetition][spaced-repetition], which exploits our
understanding of human memory to allow you to obtain a large amount of
knowledge, and then *retain that knowledge indefinitely*. 

We know from research that we remember things most *efficiently* when
we're tested infrequently over a longer time span.  If you've ever
crammed for an exam, you've probably discovered you've lost that
knowledge a week or two later. Anki and spaced repetition gives us
*anti-cramming*, letting you do a minimum of work to memorize
information over a long period of time.

The working behind spaced repetition is simple. As long as you're able
to keep remembering, the time between successive tests gradually
increases. New knowledge may be tested multiple times per
week, but things you know really well will may come up every couple
of years.  The idea is to get you to recall knowledge just before you're
about to forget it.

Provided you practice regularly, it's possible to learn and retain a
tremendous amount of information. Regular practice sounds like
it's going to be hard, but I've discovered it's actually the easiest
part.

My day is full of odd bits of time that aren't typically useful.
Waiting for a tram, for my coffee to brew, standing in line at the airport.
These chunks aren't long enough to do much with, but they're
*perfect* for Anki cards. Each card takes only a few seconds, and
if you reach your learning goals for the day there are always options
to review ahead. Because you're recycling time that would otherwise
be wasted, using Anki comes with practically no opportunity costs whatsoever!

The Anki phone app comes with the ability to configure notifications
if you have cards due. *Switch that on*. Simply having an icon on
your toolbar provides a reminder you've got cards to complete, and
can help act as a visual cue for whenever you open up your phone
and wonder what you were meant to be doing.

Anki lets you make your own decks in the desktop client.
I have decks for words I frequently
misspell, dietary intolerances of my friends, people I've met,
[subjects I've learning][coursera], [languages][duolingo], and
anything else that I know I'll easily
forget. However Anki also has a rich number of
[shared decks][anki-shared-decks]. For me personally, both
[cognitive biases](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/970971960) and
[hiragana/katakana](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1530243698)
(Japanese characters) feature heavily in my learning schedule.

Anki has clients for Windows, Mac, Linux/BSD, iOS, and Android;
as well as a mobile-friendly web interface. While the iOS client
requires payment, the others are free and open source.

So what are you waiting for? [Download Anki][anki] and start learning!
