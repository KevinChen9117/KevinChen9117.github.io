We know that gratitude is a big determinant of happiness. I know a lot
of people who keep gratitude diaries. I'm also keepig a gratitude
diary, but not the type you expect.

We all touch the lives of others. Sometimes the smile of a stranger
brightens our day, sometimes a person we admire inspires us to do
more. Sometimes we realise that we admire someone when we least
expect it.

When you change someone's life for the better, you're doing a good
thing. But so often it's easy to forget that. So often it's easy to
feel that you're *not* making a difference, that you're not appreciated,
that you're not making the world a better place.

I don't think good deeds should be forgotten.

So I'm going to ask you to keep a gratitude diary, but not the type
that everyone talks about.

Every time you've discovered that you've made someone's life better,
write it down. If someone goes out of their way in particular to
say that you've improved their life, then *definitely* write that down.
It doesn't matter if you never see them again. It doesn't matter if
you don't know their name. It doesn't matter if you later gain them
as a friend, or lose them as a friend.

You're keeping a gratitude diary, but you're recording the gratitude
expressed *towards* you.

You don't need to write in this every day, it's not a competition.

You don't need to record every single thing, but you should consider it.

You don't need to go out of your way to help others, but know that
you're making the world a better place if you do.

Out of everything we've examined—material possessions, new experiences,
knowledge, achievement, success, ideas, everything—the thing which
makes us feel most good about ourselves is *helping others*.

You're forming a book of the memories that are not
only precious to you, but also *precious to others*. You're forming a book
of the times when the world was made a better place through *your*
actions and deeds. If you ever find yourself feeling that you haven't amounted
to much, then you have a book written in your own hand that can help remind
you otherwise.
