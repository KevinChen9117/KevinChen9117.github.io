If you're reading this, it may be because I suggested that the world would
be a better place if we saw fewer gendered toilets at your conference.
I'd like to explain why.

For the longest time, we've lived in a world where we put people in
boxes, and the most common of those boxes is a thing called "gender". The
traditional thinking has been that there are two genders, and *everyone*
fits into one or the other.

Unfortunately, the traditional thinking is pretty darn awful; it makes the
world significantly more uncomfortable for anyone who doesn't fit clearly
fall into our ideas of binary gender. That can include anyone born with
genitals that don't match the traditional thinking, anyone who isn't happy
with the gender they were assigned at birth, anyone who doesn't fit our
gender stereotypes, anyone who doesn't want a gender, anyone who's gender is
fluid or ambiguous... It includes an awful lot of people.

Living in a world that enforces a gender binary is uncomfortable if you
don't fit neatly into it, and gendered toilets go a long way to contributing
to that. If you're currently transitioning, which facilities do you use? How
will other people react to that choice? Will you even be safe? That's
something a lot of people never have to worry about, but if you're
trans, fluid, agendered, or queer, then it's something you might have to
worry about. Every. Single. Day.

And it sucks.

Gendered toilets are a form of discrimination against anyone who doesn't fit
the traditional views of gender. Often they exist not because any harm is
intended, but just because there was no thought of arranging things any
other way. I dearly hope that your conference is a place where people can
feel comfortable being themselves, where they can exchange ideas, where they
can be creative, where they can do great things and make the world a better
place.

By all means, indicate if sanitary disposal facilities are available; but
please help your conference be a place where we can celebrate diversity of
gender, rather than a place which unconsciously suppresses it.
