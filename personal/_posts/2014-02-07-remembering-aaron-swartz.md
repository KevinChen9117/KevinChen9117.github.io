privacy. He was instrumental in helping retain freedom and privacy on the
Internet. He fought for civil liberties and social justice. He made the world a
better place.

I know that for many people, the thought of mass surveillance, of warrantless
wiretapping, seems abstract and remote. That's one of the reasons why it's so
insidious; by its very nature we don't see it happening.

The following video is part of a campaign that I believe strongly about.
Whether you choose to participate, or learn more, is entirely up to you. But
the video itself is a beautiful testament to Aaron's life, and changes for good
that he made in the world.
