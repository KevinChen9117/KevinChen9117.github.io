This site, and all the writing on it, is free. Not just free for you
to read, but also free for you to use, modify, change, distribute, and
re-interpret.  It's free from advertising, and to the extent of my
ability, it's [free of things that will track you].

You're probably wondering why.

It's simple. This site does not exist to make money. Instead, it
exists to make the world a better place. In particular, to make the
*future* a better place.
