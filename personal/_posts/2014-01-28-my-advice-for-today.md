My advice for you today is *don't* read social media. Most of it is rubbish,
and there's a good chance you're only reading it because you're bored. If
you're actively engaged, then fine, but if you've just spent the last 30
minutes listlessly flicking through posts, then stop that. Stop it right now.
You're not making yourself any happier.

You know how you've got that thing you enjoy, but which takes more time and
effort? Go do that instead. I don't care if it's [reading][gutenberg],
or painting, or [coding][code-academy], or [writing][written-kitten],
or [learning a language][duolingo], or [studying][coursera], or
[exercise][fitocracy], or [whatever][HPMOR]. Go do that now. If your
brain is fried, then go [listen to articles][pjf-pocket], discover
[spoken wikipedia][spoken-wikipedia], or y'know, actually sleep.

But please—unless you have [anhedonia][anhedonia]—don't spend your time bored
and listlessly scrolling through posts on social media. There's so much more
you could be doing instead.
