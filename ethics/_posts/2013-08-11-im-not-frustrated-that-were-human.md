I often say that I'm frustrated with being human, but that's not really true. A
dog may feel anger, jealousy, fear. A chimpanzee can show understanding of
consequences, but can never have the willpower to use that knowledge. Even the
simplest of animals can feel pain. But it is a uniquely human ability to
transcend those base drives, to consider the future, to do not what is easy,
but to do what is *right*. It is this uniquely human property which will take
us to the stars. It is this property which allows us to become more ethical
than the society in which we are raised.

And yet this is not something that we nurture. Conflict and drudgery wears us
down. Needless decisions erode our willpower. We value others by the money they
have in the bank, not the good they are doing for the world. Society
distrusts—and often persecutes—those who would break societal norms for the
good of the future. We encourage distraction and inaction; we encourage
obedience and conformity.

This is not how the world should be. That tiny human spark, that ultimate hope
for our future, is so easily extinguished. The spark does not exist when we're
tired. It does not exist when we're worried. It does not exist when we've been
asked to bear more than we can handle. We fall back to our base instincts; we
show fear and cowardice, we care not for those except our closest friends and
family; we stop thinking of what potential might exist, and instead think
merely of how we might survive the day.

The future should not be a place of suffering. It should not be a place where
people worry about disease or death, poverty or intolerance, where they are
worn down and constrained by their experiences. The future should be a place of
wonderment and harmony. A place of exploration and creativity. A place where
the spark is nurtured and grown. A place were we are as human as we can
possibly be. And while I believe that we will get there, I fear that we are
taking the longest road to do so.

I'm not frustrated that we're human; I'm frustrated that we're not human
enough.
