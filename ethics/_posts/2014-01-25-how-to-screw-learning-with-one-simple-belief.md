This. Right here. Look at it.

It's a graph showing the performance of children after they've been praised for
their intelligence ("you must be smart") versus their effort ("you must have
put a lot of effort into that"), and then given a series of hard problems to
try to solve. The kids who are taught that effort count *increase* in the
number of problems they can solve. Those who are told that they're smart show a
frightening decrease.

What's the difference? Those being told that they're smart are taught that
abilities are fixed. If you're finding a puzzle hard, then it must be because
you're not very good at that, and you should try something else. Kids taught
that results are based on effort see the hard puzzles as something they can
*learn* to do, and then they do so¹.

This is shown really clearly in the second graph. Children are asked what type
of puzzles they'd like to solve, and are given four options. The first three
are pretty similar: "problems that aren't too hard, so I don't get many wrong,"
"problems that are pretty easy, so I'll do well," and "problems that I'm pretty
good at, so I can show that I'm smart." However the last option is different:
"problems that I'll learn a lot from, even if I won't look so smart."

The first three options are "performance" options, they're all about looking
good, or getting things right. The last option is a "learning" option, and it
values knowledge and growth over performance.

The second graph shows how often children selected performance options based
upon the type of praise they were given. Children praised for their
intelligence choose tasks which are easy and make them look good; children
praised for their effort choose tasks which are hard, and which will teach them
more.

This is important enough, but there are social ramifications as well. People
with more fixed views of ability are more likely to adopt stereotypes, and are
less likely to develop to higher levels of ethical reasoning than those with
dynamic views of ability². And this doesn't seem to have a damn thing to do
with cognitive abilities; it's all about outlook.

Do not go through life believing that you lack a talent, and do not allow
others to believe that about themselves. Humans have an amazing capacity for
growth; learning is hard, but it's *definitely* worth it.
