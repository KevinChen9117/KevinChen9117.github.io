Your brain does not exist to do what is "right". Your brain does not exist to
make the world a better place. Your brain does not exist to make your
experience meaningful, or pleasant, or pain-free.

The sad reality is that your brain exists to maximise the reproductive success
of your ancestors. We do not have higher ethics because of our brains, but in
spite of them.

Many things which are ethically right require great willpower to achieve,
because they're the same things which were reproductively *wrong* for our
ancestors. Jealousy, indifference to suffering, selfishness; these are all
great evolutionary strategies, and yet they are terrible ethical ones.

I dream of a day when we can overcome our neurobiology and become better
people.
