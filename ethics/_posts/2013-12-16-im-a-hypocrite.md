I'm going to admit something awful. I'm a hypocrite. I don't try to hide that.
I advocate using one's resources to make the world a better place, and yet I do
a poor job of that myself. I think that raising animals for food is wrong, and
yet I still eat meat. I cannot justify these actions in any way that I feel
comfortable about.

And really, that's the point.

It would be simple for me to find a reason why I don't care about the suffering
of others. Overpopulation is an easy excuse, and it's one I've reached for in
the past. There are an endless number of excuses I can reach for to justify
eating meat. I have no doubt that I could make a show of defending these
positions if I chose to take them.

However if I give myself excuses, then I *will* hide behind them. And if I
believe my own excuses, then I won't even *try* to change my behaviour. What's
worse, I may even try to justify the behaviour of others who adopt the same
behaviour as myself.

Despite the stigma associated with being a hypocrite, and despite the cognitive
dissonance it causes, being a hypocrite provides me with something very
valuable: it still allows me to improve myself, and the world, for the better.
That social and mental discomfort pushes me towards more ethical choices, and
it allows me to support others who are improving in the same way.

If you really want me to challenge your beliefs, then I will, but I would
rather welcome you to join me in my hypocrisy. Admit that the suffering of
others *is* important—on a global scale—but that we both personally have a lot
left to be done to improve our own responses to that.
