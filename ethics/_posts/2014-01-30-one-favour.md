Dear everyone, I have a favour to ask…

Imagine the future. Not as it is next week, next year, or even in a
hundred years hence. Imagine the future as it exists in *ten thousand* years
time; and imagine that's a future where things have gone *right*.

<!--more-->

It's not a dystopia; humanity has gone beyond its roots and has colonised the
stars. We've outgrown our humble beginnings, we've overcome the flaws in our
brain: anger, jealousy, selfishness; but we've kept the things which are
important. We have compassion, and foresight. We have understanding, and
ethics. I want you to imagine the *best possible future* that you can; one
that's not just best for humanity, but also best for any being that may be able
to think or feel.

That's a big leap of imagination, but I want you to try.

Then I want you to do something in the next 24 hours—purposefully and
consciously, regardless of how big or small—which would make our
future selves *proud*.

You can share that here if you like. You can keep it to yourself. It
can be a tiny tiny thing, or it can be the crowning achievement of
your existence. But it's human nature to think about the here-and-now,
and I so dearly, dearly wish we'd spend more time working towards how
things *should* be.

Thank you.
