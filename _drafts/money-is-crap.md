I want to make the world a better place, and I'd like to do that by
example. 


Right now the web isn't a nice place to be. It's filled with advertisements
and tracking cookies. Users are the commodity which is being bought and
sold. 




Back in the bad old days we had record labels. They were crappy for
artists, because they'd take such a large share of profits. They
were crappy for consumers, because music would end up highly priced.
And they were crappy for anyone who made a mixtape, because the
record labels had *lawyers*.

Things are better now. If you make music, you can publish it on
Bandcamp and pay a modest fee for distribution. You can run
crowdfunding campaigns for concerts and new albums. It's still
hard to make money, because artists as a whole are unappreciated,
but one now has a much more direct relationship with fans.

Let's pretend you've just made something awesome. It doesn't matter if
it's a song, or a poem, a piece of art, or a piece of code. It's something
you're proud of. Now imagine you get paid for this. Feeling better?
Now imagine the person who paid you dumps your work in the bin.

How do you feel now?

Probably pretty awful. And even if you got paid a lot of money for
your work, chances are you're going to be deeply unhappy if your best
work never sees the light of day.

What I've just done is conducted a simple thought experiment, one
that explores how much we appreciate money versus recognition.
It's not surprising that we want recognition for our work; humans
psychology is hugely oriented around social standing. And while
we're raised to care about money, it seems hard-wired in to care
about social standing more.
