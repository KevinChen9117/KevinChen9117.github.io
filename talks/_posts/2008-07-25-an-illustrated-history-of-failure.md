**Note:** Apparently [blip.tv dumped many of their old conference videos without warning](https://twitter.com/chrisjrn/status/423633876011855872), including mine. If you have a copy of the 2008 OSCON performance of this video, [please let me know](https://github.com/pjf/pjf.github.io/issues/1).

The average individual is given little scope for failure, at least not the type
that really matters. The opportunity for catastrophic failure, that influences
nations or continents, has been traditionally reserved for royalty, parliament,
and others in a position of great leadership.

However in recent times we have developed a profession who have the opportunity
to fail like never before. A profession that can make mistakes that are so
monumental, so wide-reaching, and so costly they can shake civilization to its
very core. This elite group, rarely seen by every day society, are the
foundation upon which modern society depends. The few, the proud, the Software
Developers.

Join us for a voyage of discovery, as we travel back through history to some of
the most monumental failures the world has ever seen.
