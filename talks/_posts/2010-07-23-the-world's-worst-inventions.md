Technology advances through the creation of new inventions. Devices, protocols,
machines, and ideas all increase the breadth of human knowledge, and make life
easier for us all… At least in theory.

<!--more-->

In reality, the advance of progress is littered with bad ideas. A profound lack
of foresight, thinking, or just plain common sense has left us with countless
artefacts of mis-design. What’s worse, we often build upon such twisted horrors
in the creation of new technology.

Leeches that predict the weather, fire alarms that trap their users, poorly
thought-out medicines, toys which irradiate, mangle, or intoxicate their users,
and a bizarre array of poorly conceived ideas are just a few of the inventions
that litter the otherwise noble pursuit of applied science.

Join internationally acclaimed speaker Paul Fenwick as we examine some of the
worst design decisions ever made.
